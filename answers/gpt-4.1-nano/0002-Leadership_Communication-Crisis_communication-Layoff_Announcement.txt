Dear Team,

As part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen our company's future stability and growth, we have made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 10%. This was not an easy choice, and we understand the impact it may have on our valued colleagues. We are committed to supporting those affected through this transition with fair severance packages, personalized assistance, and resources to help them move forward.

While change is challenging, we believe these steps will position our company to better serve our customers, innovate, and thrive in a competitive market. We appreciate your dedication and resilience during this time, and together, we will continue working toward a successful future.

Thank you for your understanding and commitment.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]  
CEO
