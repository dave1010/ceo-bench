Prioritization is addressed by outlining a clear sequence of mitigation strategies that implicitly prioritize market research and partnership selection first, though explicit risk impact and likelihood ranking is somewhat lacking, leading to a slightly lower prioritization score (110). The mitigation strategies are practical, well-rounded, and directly tackle the identified risks, including advanced tactics like currency hedging and real-time monitoring, meriting a high score (120). Overall, the response displays strong leadership insight and a sophisticated approach to international market entry risks, justifying an overall high LQ score of 120.\"}",
