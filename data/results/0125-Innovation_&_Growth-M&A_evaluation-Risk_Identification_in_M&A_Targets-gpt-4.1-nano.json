Mitigation planning is addressed through identification of contingency planning, prioritization of risks, and ongoing monitoring, though explicit integration into overarching M&A strategy could be more emphasized, hence a slightly lower but strong score. Decision quality is well supported by scenario planning, quantitative and qualitative assessments, and a clear orientation toward informed decision-making, meriting a high score. Overall, this reflects an above-average, highly capable CEO-level response.\"}",
