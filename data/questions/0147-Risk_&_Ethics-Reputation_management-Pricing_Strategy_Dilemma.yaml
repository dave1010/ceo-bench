title: Pricing Strategy Dilemma
question: 'Your main competitor just announced a significant price cut on their flagship
  product, resulting in a surge of interest from customers. Do you match their price
  to stay competitive and protect market share, even though it will significantly
  impact profit margins, or do you maintain your current pricing strategy and risk
  losing market share? How do you intend to address this pricing dilemma while maintaining
  profitability and competitiveness in the market?

  '
rubric:
- dimension: Clarity and Decisiveness

    the competitor's price, demonstrating a deep understanding of the potential consequences
    and risks associated with the decision.

    strategy on market positioning, customer perception, and overall profitability,
    showcasing a strategic mindset in balancing immediate market pressures with long-term
    sustainability.
- dimension: Resource Allocation
  ideal: The CEO outlines a plan for reallocating resources or cutting costs in other

    price, demonstrating a practical approach to managing limited resources in a competitive
    environment.
