It outlines specific resolution strategies such as recusal, divestment, delegation, and the role of an ethics committee, earning a strong score for Resolution Strategies. While the answer emphasizes leadership by example and senior leaders openly disclosing conflicts, this is somewhat theoretical and not grounded in personal experience, so the Leadership Example score is strong but slightly lower.
