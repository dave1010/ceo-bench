The strategic planning is well thought out, proposing actionable and relevant strategies to overcome identified challenges, including localization, partnerships, and ongoing compliance. However, the discussion of risk management, while present through monitoring and compliance, lacks explicit contingency plans or a deeper balance of risks versus benefits, resulting in a slightly lower score in this dimension. Overall, the response reflects a capable CEO-level approach with room for enhanced depth in risk mitigation.\"}",
