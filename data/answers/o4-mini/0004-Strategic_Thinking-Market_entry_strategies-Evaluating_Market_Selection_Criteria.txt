Key Criteria for Evaluating a New International Market  
To ensure any market entry supports—and doesn’t distract from—your company’s strategic goals, prioritize criteria in four broad categories: Market Attractiveness, Strategic Fit, Operational Feasibility & Risk, and Financial/Performance Metrics.

1. Market Attractiveness  
   • Size and Growth Rate – Is the total addressable market (TAM) large or expanding in your segment? Fast growth amplifies upside.  
   • Profit Margins & Unit Economics – Are local price points and cost structures consistent with your margin goals?  
   • Competitive Dynamics – How saturated is the market? Can you achieve differentiation or a cost advantage?

2. Strategic Fit  
   • Core-Competency Alignment – Does the opportunity leverage your existing strengths (technology, brand, distribution)?  
   • Brand Positioning & Reputation – Will your value proposition resonate (premium vs. mass-market, B2B vs. B2C)?  
   • Portfolio Synergies – Can you bundle or cross-sell adjacent products/services to accelerate traction?

3. Operational Feasibility & Risk Profile  
   • Regulatory & Political Environment – Are laws, trade agreements, IP protections and tax regimes stable and favorable?  
   • Supply Chain & Infrastructure – Can you source inputs, manufacture, and distribute with acceptable lead times and quality?  
   • Cultural & Consumer Fit – Do local buying habits, language, and customs require major product or marketing adaptations?  
   • Entry Barriers & Exit Options – What are the costs of market setup (licenses, real‐estate, hiring) and possible off‐ramps if targets aren’t met?

4. Financial & Performance Metrics  
   • Required Investment vs. Expected ROI – What is the payback period, NPV or IRR relative to your hurdle rate?  
   • Scalability & Break-even Timeline – How quickly can you ramp sales to cover fixed costs?  
   • Currency & Repatriation Risks – Are foreign-exchange fluctuations or capital‐controls manageable?

Why These Matter  
– Focus: They keep you from chasing “shiny” but marginal opportunities that dilute management attention.  
– Risk-Adjust: A thorough risk assessment avoids unforeseen legal, political or cultural pitfalls.  
– Synergy & Leverage: Prioritizing strategic fit ensures you maximize ROI by building on what you already do well.  
– Accountability: Clear financial benchmarks and exit criteria let you measure progress and decide when to double down—or pull back.

By rigorously screening potential markets against these criteria, you align new-market expansion with your company’s broader vision, competencies, and risk appetite—maximizing the odds of a successful and profitable international rollout.
