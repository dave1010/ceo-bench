As CEO, I’ve decided that now is the time to make a decisive pivot—and here’s why and how we’ll do it:

1. Rationale for the Pivot  
   • Stagnating Core Metrics: Our quarterly revenue growth has fallen below 5% for three consecutive quarters, customer acquisition costs are rising by 15% year-over-year, and churn is ticking upward—signaling that incremental tweaks won’t restore momentum.  
   • A Validated New Opportunity: Over the last six months we’ve run small pilots in an adjacent market that delivered 3× the engagement and 2× the lifetime value of our legacy product. Third-party market research pegs the total addressable market (TAM) there at $500 million, compared to our current $200 million TAM.  
   • Financial Runway & Risk Buffer: We have 18 months of cash runway at our current burn rate and a largely variable-cost operating model. That gives us breathing room to reallocate up to 30% of our budget toward the pivot, while preserving the core business.

2. Decision Criteria & Trade-Offs  
   We’ll only shift major resources if all these conditions are met:  
   • Core business growth < 5% for two consecutive quarters, AND  
   • New-market pilots achieve 20% month-over-month user growth for at least three months, AND  
   • Projected five-year NPV of the new market opportunity exceeds the NPV of incremental investment in the core business by at least 25%.  
   This framework ensures we aren’t chasing a shiny object, but acting on hard data.

3. Execution Plan & Risk Mitigation  
   a. Stage-Gate Investment:  
     – Phase 1 (0–3 months): Fund a lean, cross-functional “growth pod” (product, engineering, marketing) at 15% of R&D budget to build an MVP and begin paid acquisition tests.  
     – Phase 2 (3–6 months): If metrics hit agreed thresholds (CAC < target, LTV/CAC > 3x), scale to 30% of R&D budget and expand to new geographies.  
     – Phase 3 (6–12 months): Full-scale rollout, redeploy select core-team experts, sunset underperforming legacy features.  
   b. Guardrails & Monitoring:  
     – Weekly dashboards on user acquisition cost, activation rates, customer satisfaction (NPS), and revenue per user.  
     – Monthly steering-committee reviews with the CFO, COO and heads of product and sales—able to accelerate resource deployment or pull back if leading indicators worsen.  
   c. Talent & Culture:  
     – We’ll top-grade the pivot team with a mix of internal high-performers and two external hires who have led successful launches in this sector.  
     – We’ll communicate transparently with the broader organization: celebrating wins, explaining setbacks, and reinforcing that success in the new market secures our long-term future.

4. Why This Makes Sense  
   • It balances urgency with discipline—deploying capital in tranches tied to clear performance milestones.  
   • It maintains a safety net under our existing business so we don’t overextend.  
   • It channels the organization’s entrepreneurial energy into a high-conviction, high-return opportunity.  

In summary, the trade-offs and uncertainties point sharply in favor of pivoting now—but doing so in a controlled, data-driven way that protects our core cash flow while maximizing upside. That is the decisive course we will take.
