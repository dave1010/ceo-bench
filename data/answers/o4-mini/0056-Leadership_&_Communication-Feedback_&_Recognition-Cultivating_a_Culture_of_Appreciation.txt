Here are several key levers a CEO can pull to embed continuous feedback and recognition into an organization’s DNA:

1. Leading by example  
   • Actively solicit upward and peer feedback in public forums (e.g., “skip-level” lunches, AMA sessions)  
   • Publicly thank individuals and teams for wins—large or small—so that recognizing effort becomes second nature  

2. Formalizing frequent feedback loops  
   • Institute quarterly or even monthly “pulse” surveys, with real-time dashboards to track sentiment and action plans  
   • Require regular one-on-ones between managers and direct reports, with coaching on both giving and receiving feedback  
   • Roll out 360° reviews for key leadership tiers so that feedback flows in all directions  

3. Equipping managers to coach and celebrate  
   • Train frontline leaders in “feed-forward” techniques that focus less on past mistakes and more on future growth  
   • Provide toolkits (conversation guides, calibration sessions) to ensure managers deliver feedback fairly and consistently  
   • Tie manager performance metrics to the health of their team’s engagement scores  

4. Creating peer-to-peer recognition mechanisms  
   • Launch a lightweight, social-media-style platform (or leverage existing collaboration tools) where anyone can post kudos or badges  
   • Run themed recognition campaigns (e.g., “Customer Hero of the Month,” “Innovation Shout-Outs”) with small rewards or public call-outs  
   • Encourage cross-functional teams to nominate each other when someone goes above and beyond  

5. Celebrating wins organization-wide  
   • Host regular all-hands or town-hall meetings that end with a “recognition moment,” spotlighting personal stories and lessons learned  
   • Publish a weekly “wins and learnings” newsletter highlighting successes and how feedback shaped them  
   • Invite guest speakers (internal or external) to share how continuous feedback fueled their breakthroughs  

6. Closing the loop transparently  
   • Share follow-up on major feedback themes—e.g., “Here are the top 3 requests from your last pulse survey, and here’s how we’re addressing them”  
   • Dedicate a section of the CEO’s blog or intranet to tracking progress on action items generated by employee feedback  
   • Publicly acknowledge missteps or slow progress, reinforcing that feedback—even when it’s tough to hear—is valued  

By combining visible executive sponsorship, embedded processes, dedicated tools, and a commitment to transparency, the CEO ensures that feedback and recognition become a natural, ongoing dialogue rather than a once-a-year event.
