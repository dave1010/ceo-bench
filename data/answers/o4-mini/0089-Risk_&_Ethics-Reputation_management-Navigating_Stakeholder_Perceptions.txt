To keep a steady hand on the wheel when the waters get choppy, a CEO doesn’t wait for a crisis to “remember” the company’s values. Instead, she or he continuously shapes, reinforces and lives those values so that, when uncertainty arrives, they’re already the default decision-making compass for everyone in the organization. Here’s how a CEO can do that proactively:  

1. Codify and Socialize Core Values  
 • Workshop with leadership: Early and often, the CEO convenes senior teams to refine the language of the values so they’re specific, actionable and tied to real business decisions.  
 • Embed in rituals: Values become part of new-hire onboarding, monthly performance reviews, compensation frameworks and promotional criteria—so everyone knows they’re more than just words on a wall.  

2. Model Behavior Relentlessly  
 • Consistent visibility: The CEO cites and connects decisions—good or bad—back to the values in all-hands, town halls and external interviews.  
 • Personal storytelling: By sharing candid examples of tough value-based calls (e.g., saying no to revenue that would compromise safety or ethics), the CEO shows that values apply at every level.  

3. Maintain Two-Way Communication  
 • Open forums and “listening tours”: During uncertain times, the CEO hosts virtual or in-person Q&A sessions to hear anxieties, answer questions and demonstrate transparency.  
 • Pulse surveys and “values heat maps”: Regular, anonymous check-ins gauge whether people feel the company is living its professed values—allowing the CEO to spot disconnects and course-correct quickly.  

4. Tie Values to Decisions in Real Time  
 • Decision-making frameworks: Crisis-response playbooks invoke core values at each decision point (e.g., “Does this preserve customer trust?” “Are we upholding our commitment to employee well-being?”).  
 • Cross-functional crisis teams: By staffing them with “values champions,” the CEO ensures every action is run through a shared ethical lens.  

5. Celebrate and Reinforce  
 • Public recognition: Quickly highlight teams or individuals who exemplify the right behaviors under stress—reinforcing that values-based choices are noticed and rewarded.  
 • Transparent post-mortems: After big challenges, the CEO leads debriefs that praise successes, own mistakes and demonstrate how values guided the learning process.  

By weaving values into daily life, decision frameworks and communications—then visibly “walking the talk”—the CEO not only preserves the company’s reputation in uncertain times but also deepens trust with employees, customers and other stakeholders.
