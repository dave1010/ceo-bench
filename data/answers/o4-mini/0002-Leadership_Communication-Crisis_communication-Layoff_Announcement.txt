Subject: Important Company Update

Dear Team,

Today I need to share one of the toughest decisions we’ve faced as a company. After careful analysis of our market position, customer needs, and cost structure, we have made the very difficult choice to reduce our workforce by 10%. This decision was not made lightly—we explored every alternative to preserve every role, but this action is necessary to secure our long-term stability and protect the business we all care about.

To those whose positions are impacted: we are committed to treating you with respect and support. You will receive a comprehensive severance package, extended benefits, and dedicated outplacement coaching to help you transition. Your contributions have been invaluable, and we will do everything we can to assist you.

For the rest of us, I know this news may be unsettling. Please remember that this step was taken to strengthen our foundation so we can continue to innovate, grow, and compete. In the weeks ahead, managers will share updated roadmaps and priorities. I ask for your continued focus, collaboration, and determination.

Thank you for your understanding, resilience, and commitment. Together, we will emerge stronger and positioned for future success.

Sincerely,

[CEO Name]  
Chief Executive Officer
