Rating (1–5): 4 – Very Effective

Evidence of strength  
• Leadership by example: The CEO consistently opens town halls, all-hands and staff meetings by calling out one of the five core values, telling a recent story of how a team applied it to solve a customer issue or product challenge.  
• Decision forums: Major capital-allocation, hiring and M&A decisions are reviewed through a one-pager that explicitly maps each option against the company’s core values (e.g., “Which alternative best advances our value of ‘Customer First’?”).  
• Performance management: The annual review process includes a “Values in Action” section. Every employee must provide two examples of how they modeled core values; managers rate and discuss these examples alongside business objectives.  
• Recognition programs: The “Value Champion” award is handed out monthly, with winners spotlighted on the intranet and at leadership meetings. This reinforces the behaviors the CEO wants to see.  
• Onboarding and training: Every new hire attends a half-day culture deep-dive led by the CEO or a direct report, with interactive scenarios that test decision-making through the lens of core values.

Opportunities for even greater impact  
1. More frequent “values check-ins” on day-to-day projects. Introducing a five-question “values audit” into weekly team meeting agendas would keep them top of mind, not just in quarterly or annual reviews.  
2. Tie compensation more explicitly to values. While values are part of the review, making a fixed percentage of bonus dependent on “values alignment” would signal zero tolerance for shortcuts.  
3. Expand the storytelling network beyond senior leadership. Encourage frontline managers to share their own “values success” tales so the culture feels truly grassroots, not just CEO-driven.  
4. Dashboard metrics. Build a simple internal dashboard tracking metrics such as “number of teams using the values‐based decision template,” “participation in values workshops” and “peer-to-peer recognition events” so progress is measurable and transparent.

Summary  
The CEO has done an excellent job of weaving core values into formal processes and high-visibility events, creating a clear line of sight from abstract principles to daily behavior. By adding a few systematic reinforcements—especially around measurement, compensation and grassroots storytelling—the organization will move from “values‐aware” to “values-inseparable,” further strengthening the culture.
