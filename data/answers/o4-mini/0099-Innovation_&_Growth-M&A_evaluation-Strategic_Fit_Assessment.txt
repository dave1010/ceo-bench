I’ve built and lead a repeatable, stage-gated M&A process that keeps every deal tightly focused on the company’s stated goals—whether that’s entering new markets, acquiring capability, or accelerating revenue growth.  Here’s how I ensure alignment and effectiveness:

1. Clarify Strategic Imperatives up-front  
   • At the start of each planning cycle we revisit our top-line corporate strategy (e.g., geographic expansion, vertical integration, product adjacencies).  
   • We translate those imperatives into “must-have” criteria for M&A targets (e.g., revenue scale, technology fit, cultural compatibility).

2. Rigorous Screening & Prioritization  
   • A cross-functional deal team (strategy, finance, R&D, HR, legal) rates every potential target on strategic fit, financial metrics (IRR, NPV, payback period), and integration complexity.  
   • Only those scoring above a predefined threshold move to preliminary due diligence, keeping our funnel disciplined.

3. Deep Due Diligence with a Strategic Lens  
   • Financial and legal diligence are run in parallel with operational, cultural, and technology assessments—so we don’t overlook hidden misalignments.  
   • We validate that combined synergies (cost, revenue, capability) map directly back to the original strategic thesis.

4. Investment Committee Oversight  
   • I chair a monthly Investment Committee that reviews all “go-no-go” items: strategic fit, downside scenarios, integration roadmap, governance structure.  
   • I push for red-team assessments to surface worst-case risks before we sign.

5. Integration-First Planning  
   • Day-One integration plans (with clear owners, milestones, and KPIs) are drafted during the diligence phase, not after close.  
   • We track integration against target synergies in weekly executive reviews for the first 100 days, then in monthly operating reviews thereafter.

Measured Outcomes  
• In the past five years we’ve closed six acquisitions, each delivering 12–18% incremental IRR and 100–150 bps of margin expansion within 24 months.  
• One example: acquiring a regional software player accelerated our market entry in South America and contributed 20% of our new-logo bookings within 18 months—exactly as forecast.  
• We’ve maintained a >90% realization of projected synergies, versus an industry average closer to 60–70%.

Continuous Improvement  
• We debrief every closed deal with a “lessons learned” charter to sharpen our screening models and due-diligence checklists.  
• We’re now piloting AI-driven target-screening tools to accelerate early-stage fit assessments.

Overall Effectiveness Rating  
On a 1–5 scale, I’d rate the effectiveness of our M&A evaluation process at a 4.5. We consistently align deals to strategy, hit our synergy targets, and limit execution surprises—while still looking for ways to tighten our playbook.
