On balance, the CEO has been highly effective at breaking down silos and ensuring that teams share both information and resources rather than working in parallel, duplicating effort.  Key evidence:

1. Cross-Functional Governance  
   • Quarterly “Resource Alignment” reviews bring all department heads together to vet new project proposals, so that R&D, marketing, IT and operations sign off on resource needs before anything goes forward.  
   • A standing Resource Allocation Committee (chaired by the COO with rotating department representation) vets overlaps and reallocates budget or staff where priorities compete.

2. Shared Planning and Reporting Tools  
   • We’ve rolled out a single portfolio-management dashboard in which every major initiative, its budget, head-count and timeline are visible to all senior leaders.  
   • That transparency has already identified and cancelled three overlapping pilots in Q1, freeing up roughly $400K and two full-time equivalents for higher-value projects.

3. Incentives and Culture  
   • The CEO reframed annual bonuses to include “collaboration metrics” (for example, percentage of deliverables delivered jointly with another department).  
   • He regularly spotlights cross-team success stories in town halls, reinforcing that jointly owned outcomes trump solo “wins.”

4. Measurable Impact  
   • Since these processes went live six months ago, the company reports a 25% reduction in redundant headcount allocations, a 15% improvement in time-to-market (because shared resources are deployed more efficiently), and clear cost savings.  
   • Employee-survey scores on “interdepartmental cooperation” have improved from 62% to 78% favorable.

Areas for further refinement:  
– Strengthening joint KPIs (for instance, tying P&L outcomes directly to cross-department squads) could lock in even tighter alignment.  
– A bi-annual “innovation summit” might surface hidden overlaps at the grassroots level, not just among senior leaders.

Overall, the CEO’s structured, tools-driven approach—combined with cultural reinforcement and revised incentives—has done an excellent job of optimizing resources and minimizing duplicate work.
