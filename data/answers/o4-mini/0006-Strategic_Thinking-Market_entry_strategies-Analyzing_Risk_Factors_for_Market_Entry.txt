Primary risks when entering a new international market typically fall into six broad categories.  Below is how I’d rank them by urgency—and the core mitigations I’d put in place first.

1. Regulatory & Political Risk  (High Priority)  
   • What can go wrong?  – Sudden law changes, licensing delays, trade barriers, expropriation risks.  
   • Mitigation steps:  
     – Deep legal due diligence (local counsel, trade-compliance experts)  
     – Engage government relations early (embassies, trade associations)  
     – Structure investment for flexibility (joint ventures, staged roll-outs, local partner shareholdings)

2. Market & Cultural Risk  (High Priority)  
   • What can go wrong?  – Poor product-market fit; misreading local tastes, distribution channels, or buying behavior.  
   • Mitigation steps:  
     – Rigorous primary research (focus groups, small-scale pilots)  
     – Hire or partner with local marketing experts  
     – Adapt packaging, pricing, messaging and sales model to local norms  

3. Currency & Economic Risk  (Medium–High Priority)  
   • What can go wrong?  – Exchange-rate swings, inflation spikes, repatriation restrictions.  
   • Mitigation steps:  
     – Natural hedges via local revenue vs. costs  
     – Financial hedging (forwards, options)  
     – Stress-test P&L under various macro scenarios  

4. Operational & Supply-Chain Risk  (Medium Priority)  
   • What can go wrong?  – Unreliable logistics, infrastructure gaps, quality control breakdowns.  
   • Mitigation steps:  
     – Map multiple suppliers and logistics routes  
     – Build in safety stock or local warehousing  
     – Implement local quality-assurance protocols  

5. Legal & Compliance Risk  (Medium Priority)  
   • What can go wrong?  – Intellectual property theft, non-compliant contracts, differing labor and tax laws.  
   • Mitigation steps:  
     – Register and enforce IP locally  
     – Standardize contracts but tailor to local regulations  
     – Engage experienced local HR and tax professionals  

6. Talent & Organizational Risk  (Lower–Medium Priority)  
   • What can go wrong?  – Difficulty hiring or retaining qualified local managers; misaligned incentives.  
   • Mitigation steps:  
     – Blend expatriate leadership with local hires for cultural balance  
     – Design compensation and career paths that reflect local norms  
     – Invest in local training and leadership development  

Prioritization logic:  
– First, secure your right to operate (regulatory/legal).  
– Second, validate there’s real demand (market/cultural).  
– Third, protect your economics (currency, tax).  
– Then build robust delivery (supply chain, operations).  
– Finally, scale sustainably with the right people and governance.

Ongoing governance:  
• A bi-monthly risk review with local leadership and HQ.  
• Early-warning KPIs (regulatory filings, pilot-market sales trends, cash-flow sensitivity).  
• A contingency “kill-switch” or staged investment plan if any critical assumptions fail.
