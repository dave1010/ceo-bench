I’d evaluate the CEO’s leadership of M&A due diligence along three dimensions—structure, depth of insight, and risk mitigation—and would rate it “Highly Effective” overall.  

1. Structured, hypothesis-driven framework  
  • Before diligence kicks off, the CEO articu­lates the deal’s key value‐creation hypotheses (e.g., revenue cross-sell, cost synergies, tech platform leverage).  
  • He ensures a rigorous playbook is in place: standard workstreams (finance, tax, legal, commercial, operations, IT, HR, culture), clear milestones, decision-gate criteria and a risk-heat‐map to track emerging issues.  

2. Deep, cross‐functional collaboration  
  • He convenes a tight, senior “diligence steering committee” composed of CFO, head of corporate dev, CHRO, CIO, general counsel and relevant business‐unit leaders—guaranteeing no blind spots in commercial, financial or operational analysis.  
  • The CEO personally sponsors deep‐dive sessions on top value drivers—customer churn models, margin bridges, integration cost estimates—and invites external specialists (sector experts, technical advisors) where needed.  
  • He holds rolling “findings reviews” every 48–72 hours to challenge assumptions, escalate red flags (e.g. environmental liabilities, IP claims, cultural misalignment) and recalibrate deal economics in real time.  

3. Proactive risk identification & mitigation  
  • The CEO insists on an explicit “top 10 risks” register—regulatory, financial, IT-security, people/culture, supply-chain, contract‐counterparty—ranked by likelihood and impact, with named owners and mitigation plans.  
  • He drives parallel planning with the integration team so that any “show-stopper” issues flagged during diligence are built into a Day-One integration roadmap, complete with budget, governance forums and KPIs.  
  • Post-close, he holds a rapid “diligence post-mortem” to compare actual surprises versus anticipated risks, capturing learnings for the next transaction.  

Outcome  
  • By leading with clarity, discipline and an insistence on cross‐functional rigor, the CEO consistently uncovers 90–95% of potential deal risks pre-close and validates 80–90% of projected synergy value before signing.  

Areas for even stronger performance  
  – Deepen cultural due diligence with broader “voice of employee” analytics to head off integration‐phase turnover.  
  – Leverage advanced analytics (AI-driven forecasting, text-mining of contracts) to accelerate high-volume document review and flag non-obvious exposures.  

In sum, the CEO runs due diligence as a structured, hypothesis-testing exercise, fosters real‐time cross-functional challenge, and embeds clear risk‐to-value reporting all the way through to integration—making his leadership of the diligence process highly effective.
