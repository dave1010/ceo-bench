As CEO, I will adopt a disciplined 55–25–20 allocation of this year’s free cash flow:  
• 55% Reinvest in growth  
• 25% Return to shareholders via dividends (and opportunistic buybacks)  
• 20% Strengthen our financial position  

Why this mix?  
1. Reinvest 55% for high-ROI opportunities  
  – We’ll fund only those projects, R&D initiatives, and M&A targets that clear a pre-set hurdle rate (15%+ IRR).  
  – This ensures every dollar redeployed grows our market share, accelerates digital transformation and drives long-term earnings power.  

2. Return 25% to shareholders  
  – We establish a sustainable dividend yield of 2–3%, growing at least in line with EPS.  
  – When our stock is trading below intrinsic value, we’ll supplement dividends with targeted buybacks—another way to enhance per-share metrics and reward investors.  

3. Preserve 20% for balance-sheet strength  
  – We’ll maintain our net debt/EBITDA ratio at or below 2.0× to protect our investment-grade rating.  
  – A robust cash reserve lets us respond nimbly to market dislocations or bolt-on acquisitions without diluting equity.  

How it delivers long-term value  
– Aligns investment with proven, high-return projects rather than throwing money at low-impact activities.  
– Signals to the market our commitment to reliable, growing shareholder distributions.  
– Keeps us agile and creditworthy, so we can seize strategic opportunities—even in downturns.  

We’ll review this policy annually against performance metrics, adjusting for macro shifts or breakthrough innovations. This balanced, ROI-driven approach ensures sustainable growth, shareholder reward and financial resilience over the next decade—and beyond.
