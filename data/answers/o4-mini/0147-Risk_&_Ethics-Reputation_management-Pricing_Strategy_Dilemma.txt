I would not reflexively match the competitor’s across-the-board price cut. Instead, I’d hold our current price points—protecting our brand’s premium positioning and margin structure—while deploying a surgical set of tactical responses to shore up vulnerable segments and reinforce our value proposition.  

1. Targeted Promotions, Not Blanket Cuts  
   • Segment customers by lifetime value (CLV) and price sensitivity to identify those most at risk of churning.  
   • Offer time-limited, personalized incentives—e.g., bundled services, loyalty credits or finance programs—only to these high-risk cohorts, preserving full price for everyone else.  

2. Value Enhancement & Differentiation  
   • Accelerate roll-out of upcoming software/feature upgrades and emphasize service guarantees, faster delivery or extended warranties.  
   • Invest in premium support tiers and customer success programs that the low-priced competitor can’t match.  

3. Cost Structure Optimization  
   • Fast-track a 3–6-month “zero-base” cost review in manufacturing, supply chain and overhead to reclaim 2–3 points of margin.  
   • Negotiate volume commitments and just-in-time inventory deals with key suppliers to lock in lower input costs.  

4. Marketing & Channel Alignment  
   • Equip our channel partners and direct-sales teams with battle cards comparing total cost of ownership (TCO), reliability and post-sale ROI vs. the competitor’s offering.  
   • Run an integrated demand-generation blitz—webinars, case studies, targeted digital ads—underscoring “why pay less when you can get more.”  

5. Continuous Price & Competitive Monitoring  
   • Stand up a “War Room” with cross-functional leads (pricing, sales, finance, product) to track competitive moves in real time and adjust our targeted offers weekly.  

By combining disciplined price integrity with precision promotions, cost savings and a sharpened value narrative, we protect our margin profile, defend market share in the most at-risk segments and keep the long-term health of the brand front and center—without spiraling into a price war.
