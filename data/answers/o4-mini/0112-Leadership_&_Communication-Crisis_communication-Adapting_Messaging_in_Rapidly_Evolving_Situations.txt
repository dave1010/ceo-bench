A CEO who needs to keep people informed—and calm—when things keep shifting will typically do four things:  
1. Keep it simple and structured  
   • Lead with the headlines: “Here’s what we know, here’s what we’re doing, here’s what we expect next.”  
   • Use plain-English, avoid jargon or long narratives so nothing gets lost in translation.  
   • Repeat the core message in every channel (all-hands, email, intranet, video note) so people see the same three bullets everywhere.  

2. Acknowledge uncertainty and own the plan  
   • Say exactly what is certain and honest about what isn’t yet. (“We don’t have full data on X, but we’re working on it with the following steps.”)  
   • Offer the next concrete action, even if it’s just “we will update you by 5 p.m. tomorrow.”  
   • Show you’re in the arena—no hiding behind legal disclaimers or PR spin.  

3. Layer in empathy and reassurance  
   • Name the emotions in the room: “I know many of you are anxious about…, and that’s natural.”  
   • Validate people’s fears, then anchor them in the team’s strengths and past successes.  
   • Close with confidence in your people and values: “Together, we’ll get through this.”  

4. Tune timing, tone, and channel to the audience  
   • For front-line teams: more frequent, bite-sized verbal check-ins or texts.  
   • For executives/board: data-rich memos or dashboards.  
   • For customers/stakeholders: a concise public statement plus an FAQ page.  
   • Actively solicit questions and feedback—and demonstrate you’ve heard them by answering directly in your next update.  

By sticking to a clear, repeatable message frame, showing both empathy and competence, and by tailoring format and frequency to each audience, the CEO can reassure people even as the situation keeps evolving.
