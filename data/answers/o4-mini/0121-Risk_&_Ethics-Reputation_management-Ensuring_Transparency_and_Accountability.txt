A CEO who wants to maintain—and even strengthen—the company’s reputation in a downturn does three things: communicates early and often, builds in accountability, and models the behavior they expect.  Here’s how that plays out in practice:

1. Proactive, multi-channel communication  
   • Weekly “state of the company” updates (all-hands, video briefings, written summaries) that describe both challenges and action plans   
   • Quarterly calls or webinars with investors and analysts where the CEO lays out key metrics, assumptions and next-step milestones  
   • Town halls (virtual or in-person) with open Q&A and real‐time polling so employees can surface concerns immediately  

2. Open-door leadership and stakeholder engagement  
   • Regular skip‐level meetings—CEO meets directly with front-line staff to hear problems unfiltered  
   • A clearly advertised “Ask Me Anything” channel (dedicated Slack/Teams channel or anonymous suggestion box)  
   • Proactive outreach to customers, suppliers and community leaders to acknowledge issues and co-create solutions  

3. Robust accountability frameworks  
   • Publicly published scorecards or dashboards tracking progress against turnaround goals (cost savings, revenue stabilization, product-safety metrics, etc.)  
   • Empowered audit and risk committees that report directly to the board on financial controls, compliance, and remedial actions  
   • Third-party reviews or external auditors brought in to validate data and remediation plans  

4. Reinforcing an ethical culture  
   • A refreshed code of conduct rolled out company-wide, with mandatory training and clear examples of “what good looks like” when making tough trade-offs  
   • A well-publicized whistleblower hotline (with guaranteed non-retaliation) and a rapid‐response team to investigate issues transparently  
   • “Integrity score” added to leadership appraisals and incentive plans so managers know that honesty and accountability matter as much as hitting financial targets  

5. Leading by example  
   • CEO takes personal accountability—openly acknowledges mistakes or setbacks and walks through corrective measures  
   • Public commitments (e.g., to sustainability, diversity or product-safety milestones) signed in writing and revisited at every earnings call  
   • Visible trade-offs—when belt-tightening is required, the CEO and executive team take the biggest pay cuts first, signaling shared sacrifice  

By combining high-frequency, candid communication with clear metrics and personal accountability, a CEO turns “difficult times” into an opportunity to reinforce trust—both inside the organization and out.
