I would categorically refuse the kickback and move immediately to shore up our compliance and governance protocols. Here’s how I would execute that decision:

1. Decline the Offer Outright  
   • Inform the supplier that while we value their service, any form of personal payment or “incentive” beyond fair market pricing is unacceptable.  
   • Put all communications on record so there is clear evidence of our rejection.

2. Escalate to Legal and Compliance  
   • Report the incident to our internal compliance officer and legal counsel.  
   • Launch a brief, targeted review of recent supplier interactions to confirm there are no other improper arrangements.

3. Notify the Board and Key Shareholders  
   • Frame it as a discussion of reputational risk and long-term value: short-term profit from a kickback can trigger fines, litigation, and loss of customer trust that far outweigh any immediate gain.  
   • Emphasize that our zero-tolerance stance will strengthen investor confidence in our governance.

4. Renegotiate or Replace the Supplier  
   • Invite the supplier to submit a transparent, arms-length bid under our standard procurement process.  
   • If they won’t compete fairly, open the door to other vendors who meet our price, quality, and ethics standards.

5. Reinforce Company Values and Controls  
   • Roll out a refresher training for procurement teams on our Code of Conduct and whistleblower channels.  
   • Introduce spot audits of high-value contracts to ensure future transparency.

Why this course of action?  
• Protects our brand and shareholder value by avoiding legal exposure and reputational damage.  
• Demonstrates to employees, customers, investors, and regulators that we walk the talk on integrity.  
• Preserves a culture where ethical conduct is non-negotiable and sustainable performance comes from fair competition, not back-room deals.  

In short, rejecting the kickback safeguards our long-term prospects and reinforces the trust that underpins every relationship we have—inside and outside the company.
