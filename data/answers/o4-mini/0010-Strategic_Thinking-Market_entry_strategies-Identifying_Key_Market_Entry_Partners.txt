To identify and evaluate partners for a new‐region market entry, I’d follow a structured, stage-gate process:  

1. Clarify strategic objectives  
   • Define our go-to-market model (direct vs. indirect sales, joint venture, licensing, etc.)  
   • Establish target segments, price points, and service‐level requirements  
   • Set KPIs for speed to market, revenue, brand positioning, regulatory compliance  

2. Develop partner selection criteria  
   • Local market knowledge and regulatory expertise  
   • Established distribution or sales network in target segment(s)  
   • Reputation, brand alignment, cultural fit and language capabilities  
   • Financial stability and ability to make up-front investments  
   • Operational capabilities (logistics, after-sales support, technical resources)  
   • Technology/platform compatibility for order processing, CRM, reporting  
   • Shared vision on customer experience, values, governance  

3. Build a long list of potential candidates  
   • Leverage internal networks (regional leaders, existing customers/suppliers)  
   • Tap industry associations, trade shows, embassy/commercial‐attaché contacts  
   • Commission third-party market research or partner‐scouting firms  
   • Scan local business directories, LinkedIn, trade publications  

4. Conduct initial screening (desk research)  
   • Review financial health (revenue trends, profitability, debt levels)  
   • Scan press coverage, customer reviews, litigation or regulatory issues  
   • Map product/service portfolio, pricing structure and market share  
   • Validate leadership team backgrounds and cultural compatibility  

5. Engage for deeper due diligence  
   • Issue a Request for Information (RFI) or high-level questionnaire  
   • Hold exploratory calls or workshops to surface capabilities and commitment  
   • Check references: current customers, suppliers, industry peers  
   • If relevant, conduct on-site visits to distribution centers, showrooms or offices  

6. Evaluate strategic and operational fit  
   • Synergies: complementary products, cross-sell/up-sell potential  
   • Technology/integration: ERP, e-commerce, data-sharing readiness  
   • Go-to-market alignment: sales incentives, marketing programs, customer journey  
   • Governance model: decision-rights, escalation procedures, conflict resolution  

7. Risk assessment and mitigation  
   • Regulatory/licensing: import/export, data privacy, local employment laws  
   • Credit and FX exposure, payment terms, taxation  
   • Brand/reputation: local controversies, environmental or labor practices  
   • Exit scenarios: contract duration, termination clauses, IP protections  

8. Pilot or phased rollout  
   • Structure a small-scale pilot in one region or channel  
   • Define rapid feedback loops and short-cycle performance reviews  
   • Adjust commercial terms, service-level agreements and joint processes  

9. Finalize partnership agreement  
   • Negotiate clear KPIs, revenue‐share or margin structures, investment commitments  
   • Establish joint governance (steering committee, quarterly reviews)  
   • Align on marketing co-funding, training schedules and operational hand-offs  

10. Ongoing performance management  
   • Track against agreed financial, operational and customer satisfaction metrics  
   • Maintain regular communication (dashboards, site visits, joint business plans)  
   • Be prepared to invest further or re-negotiate as market conditions evolve  

By combining rigorous screening, mutual-fit assessments and a low‐risk pilot phase, you maximize the chance of selecting a partner who not only accelerates market entry but also builds a durable, value-creating alliance.
