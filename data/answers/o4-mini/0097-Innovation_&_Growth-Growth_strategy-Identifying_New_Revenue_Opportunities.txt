A CEO who’s serious about sustained growth treats new‐revenue discovery as a disciplined, ongoing process rather than as luck or occasional inspiration. Here’s a practical playbook:

1. Systematic Market & Technology Scanning  
   • Maintain a small “horizon-3” team whose sole job is to scan adjacent industries, emerging technologies, regulatory shifts and demographic trends.  
   • Leverage external advisors (academia, consultants, venture funds) and subscription data services to surface early signals of opportunity.

2. Deep Customer & Channel Insight  
   • Institutionalize Voice-of-Customer across all business units. Run quarterly customer forums and shadowing programs to uncover unmet needs and willingness to pay.  
   • Map existing and potential distribution channels—digital, partner ecosystems, platform plays—to understand how new offers could be sold or embedded.

3. Cross-Functional Ideation & Open Innovation  
   • Host regular “innovation sprints” or hackathons with R&D, sales, marketing, finance and even select customers or startups.  
   • Maintain an ideas portal where employees, partners or even lead customers can submit business concepts for sponsorship.

4. Rigorous Stage-Gate Evaluation & Prioritization  
   • Apply a lightweight stage-gate process:  
     – Gate 1: Problem-solution fit—does this address a real, validated customer pain?  
     – Gate 2: Market attractiveness and team capability—evaluate market size, competitive landscape, required skill sets.  
     – Gate 3: Financial viability—project revenues, costs, margins, cash-flow timing, and run sensitivity analyses on key assumptions.  
   • Use a simple prioritization matrix scoring each opportunity on strategic alignment, expected ROI, time-to-market and execution risk.

5. Agile Pilots & Rapid Learning  
   • For top-scoring concepts run small, time-boxed pilots or Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) in representative markets or customer segments.  
   • Establish clear success metrics (customer acquisition cost, unit economics, Net Promoter Score) and commit a small dedicated budget and cross-functional team.

6. Portfolio Management & Resource Allocation  
   • Treat your revenue streams like an investment portfolio:  
     – Horizon 1 (core business): fund for optimization and defense.  
     – Horizon 2 (adjacencies): seed with moderate investments and sponsorship.  
     – Horizon 3 (disruptive bets): assign a capped “innovation fund” and clear kill criteria.  
   • Rebalance quarterly: kill underperformers, double-down on pilots hitting key metrics, and reallocate resources toward the most promising opportunities.

7. Governance, Accountability & Incentives  
   • Report progress on new streams at every Board meeting—use dashboards that track pipeline stage, pilot results and forecasted contribution to overall growth.  
   • Tie a portion of executive and business-unit leader bonuses to hitting targets for new-stream revenue contribution (for example, 10 percent of total revenue must come from offerings launched in the last 24 months).

By embedding this cycle—scan, ideate, evaluate, pilot, scale—into the company’s operating rhythm and balancing ambition with disciplined go/no-go decisions, the CEO ensures a steady flow of viable new revenue engines to underwrite sustained growth.
