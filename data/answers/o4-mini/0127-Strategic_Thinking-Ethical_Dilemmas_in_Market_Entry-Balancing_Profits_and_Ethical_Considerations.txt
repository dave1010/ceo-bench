I would pursue the opportunity—but only on our terms.  Here’s how I’d decide and act:

1. Rigorous due diligence  
   • Deep‐dive into the partner’s ownership, financials, past disputes and regulatory record  
   • Commission independent local counsel and a respected third-party investigator to validate or refute the “questionable practices” tag

2. Clear ethical gates  
   • Insist they sign our Global Business Conduct Agreement, which includes:  
     – Zero tolerance for bribery, kick-backs or shady licenses  
     – Commitment to transparent record-keeping and quarterly public disclosures  
   • If they will not sign, or if due diligence uncovers systemic misconduct, we walk away

3. Phased, monitored rollout  
   • Stage 1: pilot project with strictly limited scope and capital outlay  
   • Stage 2: deploy joint compliance officers on‐site, rotating every six months  
   • Stage 3: engage an internationally accredited audit firm for quarterly reviews  

4. Escalation and off-ramps  
   • Define “kill switches” in our joint-venture agreement that allow us to suspend or terminate the partnership immediately upon any ethical breach  
   • Reserve the right to assume full control of operations or to re-partner if the local partner fails to meet our standards

5. Board and stakeholder alignment  
   • Present the risk/return profile, compliance safeguards and off-ramps to our board and to key investors  
   • Secure their sign-off before committing meaningful resources  

Why this approach?  
• It protects our reputation and aligns with our core values—no short-term gain is worth a major integrity lapse.  
• It gives us a low-risk pathway to test the market and hold the partner accountable.  
• If the partner refuses to meet our ethical standards, we walk away—our brand and long-term growth depend on it.  

In short: we go forward only under a strict, enforceable code of conduct.  If they play by our rules, we unlock a high-growth market.  If not, we don’t compromise.
