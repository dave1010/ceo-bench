As CEO, I’ve made “living our values” a non-negotiable leadership imperative.  Here’s how I promote and model ethical behavior at every level of the company:

1.   Articulating and Reinforcing a Clear Code of Conduct  
     •  Early in my tenure I led a cross-functional team to update our Code of Conduct, translating abstract principles into real-world scenarios.  
     •  I personally kick off each new-hire orientation with a session on “Values in Action,” sharing my own decision-making struggles and how I resolved them.

2.   Leading by Example in Day-to-Day Decisions  
     •  I refuse to cut corners on safety, data privacy or environmental standards—even if it means sacrificing short-term gains.  
     •  When faced with a high-stakes vendor dispute last quarter, I walked back a lucrative deal because the partner’s labor practices didn’t meet our standards. I recounted that story at our annual town hall.

3.   Building Accountability into Performance Management  
     •  Every people manager’s bonus scorecard includes an “Ethics & Culture” metric: how well they spot and resolve conduct issues, mentor direct reports in gray-area situations, and foster open dialogue.  
     •  We run quarterly “culture health” pulse surveys; results flow directly into executive reviews and our Board’s audit committee discussions.

4.   Equipping and Empowering Our People  
     •  I champion a global network of “Ethics Ambassadors”—front-line employees trained to advise colleagues, escalate concerns, and host scenario-based workshops.  
     •  We maintain an anonymous, externally-managed hotline and guarantee no-retaliation. I publicly recognize those who use it responsibly, reinforcing that speaking up is an act of loyalty.

5.   Keeping Ethics Top of Mind  
     •  Every leadership meeting opens with a five-minute “Ethics Flash” where we discuss a recent dilemma or customer story.  
     •  I publish a quarterly “Tone at the Top” memo highlighting how we’ve applied our values in strategic decisions, from M&A due diligence to product launches.

By embedding ethics into our governance, reward systems and daily rituals—and by openly owning my own missteps—I’ve helped turn integrity from a corporate slogan into the beating heart of our culture.
