I’d move forward with the expansion—but in a tightly controlled, phased approach that balances our need for long-term market leadership with prudent cash management today.  

1. Phased Roll-out and Investment Caps  
   • Phase 1 (6–9 months): Allocate a defined pilot budget (no more than 30% of the total requested capex) to establish a beachhead in one or two key cities, build partnerships, validate go-to-market assumptions, and hit early customer-acquisition KPIs.  
   • Phase 2 (next 12 months): If pilot metrics (customer growth rate, unit economics, contribution margin) meet pre-set thresholds, unlock the remainder of funding for national/regional scale-up. If they miss, we pause, re-calibrate or re-prioritize resources.

2. Financial Oversight and Short-Term Profitability  
   • We’ll fund the pilot from existing cash flow plus a modest draw on our revolving credit facility—preserving liquidity and our investment-grade credit rating.  
   • We accept a controlled EBITDA hit of up to 5% in the next two quarters, but ensure our core business continues to generate at least 15% margin.  
   • We institute weekly burn vs. milestone reviews with the CFO’s office and set automatic “kill-switch” triggers if we underperform by more than 20% at any check-point.

3. Strategic Rationale  
   • High‐growth market aligns with our 3- to 5-year vision to become the category leader, diversifies our revenue base, and strengthens competitive moats (local partnerships, brand awareness).  
   • Early‐mover advantage there creates barriers for later entrants once we’ve established supply chain and customer loyalty.  
   • A successful expansion is projected to deliver a 25–30% IRR over five years, far outpacing returns on redeploying that capital into our mature markets.

By combining discipline on spend with clear, measurable go/no-go milestones, we protect short-term profitability while positioning ourselves to capture a rapidly expanding market. That decisive balance—investing where the returns justify the risk—is exactly how we deliver sustainable shareholder value.
