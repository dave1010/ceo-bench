Overall Rating: 4 out of 5

Summary  
The CEO demonstrates strong ability to bring multiple—and sometimes competing—stakeholder agendas into line with the company’s strategic priorities. They have clear vision, communicate effectively, and make trade-offs in a transparent way. 

Evidence of Proficiency  
• Vision-driven communication  
  – Regular town-halls, quarterly strategy updates, investor days and partner roundtables ensure everyone hears the same narrative about where the company is headed and why.  
• Cross-functional governance  
  – The CEO chairs a quarterly “Strategy Council” of key functional leaders (finance, R&D, sales, HR, corporate affairs) plus customer and community advisory voices to surface conflicts and align on decision rules.  
• Balanced scorecard approach  
  – Financial, operational, ESG and customer-satisfaction metrics all feed into executive compensation. This drives managers to keep multiple stakeholder outcomes in view rather than optimizing for any single constituency.  
• Active stakeholder mapping and prioritization  
  – High‐stakes initiatives are run through a formal stakeholder-impact framework that identifies dependencies, potential overruns, regulatory or community objections and action plans for each group.

Areas for Improvement  
• Deepening customer- and community-level engagement  
  – While formal processes exist, embedding customer- and community- advocates on day-to-day project teams could surface localized insights earlier.  
• Short-term versus long-term trade-off clarity  
  – Some frontline managers report tension between quarterly financial targets and multi-year R&D or sustainability goals. A clearer communication of “anchor priorities” in down-cycles would help.  
• Feedback-loop acceleration  
  – Stakeholder input sometimes arrives too late in the planning cycle. Instituting rolling “feedback weeks” before every major decision could tighten the loop.

Recommended Next Steps  
1. Embed rotating customer/community liaisons on key project teams.  
2. Institute a pre-decision “feedback sprint” to gather and triage stakeholder input two cycles out from launch.  
3. Reinforce the balanced scorecard by publishing quarterly “stakeholder impact snapshots” alongside financial results.
