A CEO who wants to stay ahead of hidden slow‐downs builds a rhythm of data, dialogue and experimentation into the company’s daily work.  Here’s how that plays out in practice:

1. Establish clear, real‐time indicators  
   • Define the handful of leading KPIs (cycle time, throughput, quality rates, on-time delivery, etc.) that signal problems before they blow up.  
   • Invest in dashboards and alerts so every executive and frontline leader can see performance gaps as they emerge.  

2. Map and stress‐test critical workflows  
   • Sponsor cross‐functional process-mapping workshops to document end-to-end handoffs and hand-backs.  
   • Run “Gemba walks” or shop-floor reviews with senior leaders to observe work in its natural setting.  
   • Use value-stream or swim-lane maps to annotate where delays, rework or waste most often occur.  

3. Create safe feedback loops  
   • Host regular forums (town halls, skip-level meetings, digital suggestion boxes) to capture employee insights on friction points.  
   • Reward teams that flag glitches early and share constructive solutions.  
   • Tie incentive plans—bonus pools, recognition awards—to measurable improvements in flow and speed.  

4. Drill into root causes with rapid experiments  
   • When a dashboard alarm or employee report surfaces a bottleneck, convene a small cross-functional “rapid improvement” team.  
   • Apply lean/Six Sigma tools (5-why analysis, fishbone diagrams) to pinpoint the true constraint.  
   • Pilot low-cost process tweaks or technology patches in a single business line before rolling out broadly.  

5. Reengineer, automate or reallocate resources  
   • For chronic choke points, invest in automation, better IT integrations or simplified approval protocols.  
   • Cross-train staff or realign teams so headcount flexes with demand rather than gets stuck in silos.  
   • Leverage external partners or centers of excellence when internal capacity is limited.  

6. Institutionalize continuous improvement  
   • Turn one-off fixes into standard operating procedures, update training materials and build checklists.  
   • Celebrate metrics gains in all-hands meetings to reinforce that removing friction is everyone’s job.  
   • Review process performance regularly in the leadership team agenda—don’t let wins or new bottlenecks slip off the radar.  

By combining transparent metrics, hands-on observation, structured problem solving and a “fail fast, learn fast” mindset, the CEO ensures the organization spots its weakest links early and continually tightens the end-to-end flow of work.
