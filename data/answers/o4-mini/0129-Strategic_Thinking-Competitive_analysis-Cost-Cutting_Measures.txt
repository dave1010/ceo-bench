My decision as CEO is to launch a “Strategic Cost Transformation” built on three pillars—Surgical Efficiency, Shared Sacrifice and Growth Reinvestment—so that we achieve meaningful savings without gutting morale and preserve our ability to compete over the long haul.

1. Surgical Efficiency  
  • Zero-Based Budgeting: Every department rebuilds its budget from scratch, challenging each cost line—travel, vendors, subscriptions—rather than applying across-the-board cuts.  
  • Process Automation & Simplification: We target low-value, repetitive tasks for automation (RPA, AI assistants), and redraw workflows to eliminate handoffs and bottlenecks.  
  • Supplier Renegotiation: We open contracts for competitive rebidding or volume-based discounts in procurement, IT, and facilities.

2. Shared Sacrifice  
  • Tiered Compensation Adjustments: Executive pay and the leadership team take the largest temporary pay cuts (15–25%), mid-level managers 10%, and front-line employees 5%—all for six months—after which we reevaluate against performance targets.  
  • Hiring Freeze & Voluntary Programs: We suspend non-critical hiring, offer a voluntary separation package, and pilot a short-time work program where employees can choose a temporary reduced schedule with partial unemployment support.  
  • Transparent Communication: We hold all-hands town halls, weekly “State of the Company” updates and open Q&A sessions. Clarity on why every dollar counts helps preserve trust.

3. Growth Reinvestment  
  • Ring-fence 30% of Saved Funds: We dedicate a portion of savings to high-ROI initiatives—digital product enhancements, customer-experience improvements, and targeted marketing—to protect and grow revenue.  
  • Agile Innovation Teams: Small cross-functional squads prototype new features or service offerings in 90-day sprints, funded by the reinvestment pool.  

Why this works  
  • We attack costs methodically—rather than indiscriminate layoffs—so we preserve critical skills and customer-facing capabilities.  
  • By asking leaders to shoulder the biggest cuts, we reinforce the message that “we’re all in this together,” which sustains morale and engagement.  
  • The ring-fenced growth fund ensures we don’t starve the business of innovation when competitive pressure is highest.  

The result: a leaner, more focused organization that has shared the burden fairly, maintained employee trust, and remains positioned to invest in the initiatives that will drive our next phase of growth.
