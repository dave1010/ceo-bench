Rating: 4 out of 5

Strengths  
1. Rigorous front-end diligence.  From the moment the deal is signed, the CEO deploys cross-functional teams (finance, operations, sales, IT, HR) to map out both hard (cost savings, supply-chain consolidation) and soft (cross-sell potential, talent uplift, cultural fit) synergies.  
2. Quantified synergy models.  Synergies are broken into discrete line items, each with its own timeline, owner, and P&L impact.  This lets the organization prioritize “quick wins” (e.g., headcount rationalization, facility consolidations) while protecting longer-term revenue levers (up-sold products, new market entry).  
3. Dedicated Integration Management Office (IMO).  A small, empowered team reports directly to the CEO, tracks progress against monthly synergy targets, flags slippage, and drives corrective action with business-unit leaders.  
4. Transparent accountability.  Targets and timetables are communicated throughout the leadership team.  Success in hitting synergy milestones is part of each executive’s performance review and incentive plan.

Areas for improvement  
1. Revenue-synergy execution.  While cost synergies routinely run at 90%+ of plan, cross-sell and go-to-market synergies have trailed projections (about 60–70% realized in past deals).  A sharper focus on joint sales incentives and coordinated product-roadmap governance could close that gap.  
2. Cultural/integration risk.  Early‐stage surveys and “culture profiles” are conducted, but few hard metrics track employee engagement or leadership alignment post‐close.  Embedding regular pulse-checks and agile change-management squads would help surface and resolve friction before it erodes value.  
3. Scenario stress-testing.  Synergy plans generally assume benign market conditions.  Incorporating downside scenarios (e.g., customer attrition, supplier pushback) into the financial model and contingency planning would reduce execution risk.

Summary  
The CEO has built a robust framework for identifying, quantifying, and tracking M&A synergies—delivering strong cost-side results and a respectable share of revenue upside.  With a more structured emphasis on cultural integration and risk-adjusted synergy modeling, the team should be able to capture north of 85–90% of total deal value on every transaction.
