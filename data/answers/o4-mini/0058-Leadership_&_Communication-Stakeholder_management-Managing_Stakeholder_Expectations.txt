A CEO plays a pivotal role in making sure every major project stays true to the company’s long-term strategy and that all of its stakeholders—from board members to business-unit leaders to external partners—share a common understanding of what “success” looks like.  Here’s how a CEO typically manages that alignment through each phase of a project:

1. Before the Project Starts (Initiation & Chartering)  
   • Articulate the Strategic Rationale  
     – Host an executive off-site or strategy session to restate the company’s vision, mission and top strategic priorities.  
     – Explain how the new project supports one or more pillars of the strategic plan (growth, innovation, operational excellence, etc.).  
   • Map and Engage Stakeholders  
     – Identify all stakeholder groups (board, investors, customers, regulators, key business units, partners).  
     – Conduct one-on-one briefings to gather their objectives, concerns and success criteria.  
   • Establish Governance and Roles  
     – Appoint an executive sponsor (often the CEO or a direct report) and form a steering committee.  
     – Define RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) for key decisions.  
   • Approve a Project Charter  
     – Ensure the charter links deliverables to strategic metrics or OKRs.  
     – Secure formal sign-off from all stakeholders before funding and resources are committed.

2. Planning Phase  
   • Cascade Strategic Objectives into KPIs and Milestones  
     – Work with the PMO and finance to translate strategy into measurable targets (e.g., revenue impact, cost savings, time to market).  
     – Set stage-gate criteria that reflect both project health (scope, schedule, budget) and strategic health (alignment to priorities).  
   • Align Resource Allocation  
     – Prioritize staffing and budget in line with strategic urgency.  
     – Resolve competing demands by referring back to the strategic dashboard.

3. Execution Phase  
   • Regular Steering‐Committee Reviews  
     – Hold bi-monthly or monthly check-ins with the steering committee to review progress against milestones and strategic metrics.  
     – Surface risks and change requests, and decide which ones to escalate based on strategic impact.  
   • Transparent Communications  
     – Publish a concise, consistent dashboard (traffic-light or red-amber-green status) that ties project performance to strategy.  
     – Use town halls, leadership team meetings and intranet updates to reinforce how day-to-day work ladders up to the company’s goals.  
   • Manage Scope and Change  
     – Insist on formal change‐control processes: any proposed change must include an assessment of strategic trade-offs.  
     – Push back on “scope creep” that dilutes strategic focus.

4. Monitoring & Control  
   • Real-Time KPIs and Forecasting  
     – Leverage business‐intelligence tools for live tracking of critical metrics (revenue impact, customer adoption, ROI, risk exposure).  
     – Review these in your weekly or monthly executive-leadership meetings.  
   • Rapid Escalation Pathways  
     – Make sure any deviation that threatens strategic objectives is immediately elevated to the CEO or steering committee for a go/no-go decision.

5. Closing & Post‐Implementation  
   • Formal Sign-Off and Handover  
     – Confirm that deliverables meet the strategic success criteria established in the charter.  
     – Obtain final approvals from all stakeholder groups.  
   • Lessons Learned and Benefits Realization  
     – Conduct a post-mortem or retrospective to capture what drove strategic alignment and what hindered it.  
     – Track actual vs. forecasted benefits, and share results broadly to build confidence and institutionalize best practices.  
   • Celebrate and Communicate Success  
     – Publicly recognize the team for delivering on the company’s top priorities.  
     – Use internal communications and PR (if appropriate) to reinforce how the project advanced the company’s strategic agenda.

By embedding strategy into every decision point—from the project charter to stage-gate approvals to the final benefit-realization review—a CEO ensures that stakeholder expectations never drift away from what matters most to the business.
