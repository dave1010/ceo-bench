I’d pursue a middle‐path that protects our margins while boosting customer satisfaction—and tie both to long-term value creation. Specifically:  
1. Implement a targeted, data-driven price adjustment rather than a blanket cut.  
   • Identify high-churn or price-sensitive segments (e.g. first-time buyers, lapsed customers) and offer them a modest, temporary 5–8% discount through our loyalty program.  
   • Leave our core pricing intact for less price-sensitive, high-margin segments.  

2. Offset the margin impact through operational and supply-chain efficiencies.  
   • Launch an immediate cost-reduction initiative with procurement (supplier renegotiation, packaging redesign, logistics optimization) to reclaim at least a 3–5% improvement in COGS.  
   • Fast-track digital tools (automated pricing engines, demand forecasting) to eliminate waste and improve inventory turns.  

3. Tie performance to clear, shared KPIs.  
   • Customer-centric metrics: Net Promoter Score (NPS), repeat-purchase rate, loyalty-program enrollment.  
   • Financial metrics: blended gross margin floor, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), payback period on promotional spend.  
   • Review these monthly and adjust our price/distribution mix if we stray beyond pre-set margin thresholds.  

Why this approach?  
• It gives Marketing a concrete lever to drive satisfaction and loyalty in the segments that need it most.  
• It gives Finance confidence that we’re protecting overall margins through cost savings and dynamic pricing controls.  
• It aligns everyone around the same goal—long-term profitable growth—rather than a binary “price cut vs. no price cut” debate.  

By combining selective price relief, operational discipline, and real-time tracking, we’ll strengthen customer relationships without jeopardizing the bottom line—and position us to invest in future innovation and market share gains.
