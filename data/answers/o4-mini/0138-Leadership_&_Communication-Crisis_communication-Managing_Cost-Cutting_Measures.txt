I would take the following decisive, three-phased approach:

1.    Immediate, non-headcount savings (protect morale)  
•    Executive and leadership pay cuts—across-the-board 10–15% reduction, rolled into equity or deferred compensation.  
•    Hiring freeze on all non-mission-critical roles.  
•    Re-negotiate vendor contracts and consolidate subscriptions, targeting a 15% reduction in discretionary spend.  

2.    Shared sacrifice and redeployment (minimize layoffs)  
•    Offer voluntary unpaid leave, reduced-hour “job share” arrangements, and early-retirement packages.  
•    Identify underutilized talent and retrain/redeploy them into high-impact initiatives (e.g., customer success, digital channels).  
•    Establish a small, cross-functional “agile task force” to accelerate quick-win efficiency projects and new revenue pilots.  

3.    Measured, transparent workforce adjustment (last resort)  
•    Only if the above fail to close at least 70% of our shortfall in 8–10 weeks would I proceed with targeted layoffs—capping reductions at no more than 5–7% of total headcount.  
•    Prioritization based on clear performance metrics and future-critical skills, not tenure or department politics.  
•    Provide generous severance, health-care extension, and outplacement support to every impacted employee.  

Why this matters:  
•    Financial health—immediate cost relief without gutting the organization.  
•    Morale and trust—by sharing sacrifices and communicating openly, we preserve engagement and institutional knowledge.  
•    Agility and growth—redeployment and innovation pilots keep us focused on the future, not just survival.  

This balanced plan demonstrates to the board that we’re controlling costs decisively, but also that we value our people and retain the talent and culture that will power our rebound.
