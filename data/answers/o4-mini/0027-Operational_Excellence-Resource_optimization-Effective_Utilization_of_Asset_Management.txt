To ensure that a company’s assets—financial, physical, human and intellectual—are deployed for maximum productivity and ROI, a CEO typically puts in place a combination of strategic, operational and cultural levers.  Here’s how that plays out in practice:

1. Set Clear Strategic Priorities  
  • Define the highest-value markets, products or services and the required capabilities to win there.  
  • Align capital investment (CAPEX) and operating budgets (OPEX) with those priorities.

2. Establish Rigorous Governance and Budgeting  
  • Institute a disciplined budget cycle (e.g. annual budgeting plus quarterly rolling forecasts).  
  • Require business units to submit ROI analyses or business cases for major projects or asset purchases.  
  • Use a capital-allocation committee or investment review board to vet proposals against corporate objectives.

3. Deploy Performance Metrics and Dashboards  
  • Track key indicators such as return on capital employed (ROCE), asset turnover, working-capital days, margin per asset, and utilization rates.  
  • Tie executive and business-unit incentives to those metrics to ensure accountability for efficient asset use.

4. Drive Operational Excellence  
  • Adopt lean, Six Sigma or other continuous-improvement methodologies to eliminate waste, reduce cycle times and raise throughput.  
  • Use technology (ERP systems, IoT sensors, advanced analytics) to monitor asset performance in real time and identify downtime or under-utilization.

5. Optimize the Asset Portfolio  
  • Regularly review fixed and non-core assets for divestiture or redeployment if they do not meet return thresholds.  
  • Centralize or share facilities and capabilities where scale advantages can be leveraged.

6. Institute Rigorous Risk and Audit Controls  
  • Implement internal audit routines to ensure proper maintenance, insurance and compliance of physical and financial assets.  
  • Stress-test asset valuations under different market scenarios to guard against obsolescence or impairment.

7. Cultivate a Culture of Ownership and Accountability  
  • Empower front-line managers with clear profit-and-loss responsibility for “their” assets.  
  • Reward teams who find innovative ways to stretch resources and exceed productivity targets.

8. Leverage Data-Driven Decision Making  
  • Invest in analytics platforms that integrate financial, operational and market data.  
  • Use predictive models to forecast maintenance needs, optimize inventory levels and time capital expenditures for peak ROI.

9. Engage in Continuous Portfolio Rebalancing  
  • Periodically reallocate capital from lower-return to higher-return businesses or geographies.  
  • Pursue bolt-on acquisitions or partnerships that fill capability gaps without over-investing in build-from-scratch assets.

10. Review and Adapt  
  • Report progress quarterly to the board against asset-efficiency targets.  
  • Be prepared to pivot resources if market conditions shift or new opportunities emerge.

By combining disciplined capital-allocation processes, hard-nosed performance metrics, operational rigor and a culture that treats every dollar of asset base as a scarce and precious resource, a CEO can drive toward optimal utilization, higher productivity and superior returns on investment.
