A CEO’s role in coordinating and motivating cross‐disciplinary teams for a market-entry is first and foremost about creating clarity of purpose, then building the structure, cadence, incentives and culture that keep everyone rowing in the same direction.  Here’s how I’d do it:

1. Articulate a single, compelling vision and business case  
   • Clearly define the target market, customer pain points, expected return on investment, and key success metrics (e.g., revenue, market share, NPS).  
   • Tell the “story” of why this entry matters now, how it fits our long-term strategy, and what winning looks like in concrete terms.

2. Establish a cross-functional leadership team  
   • Appoint senior sponsors from each discipline—product, marketing, sales, finance, legal/regulatory, operations, customer success, HR.  
   • Give them co-accountability for the plan’s P&L, schedule, and risk mitigation.  

3. Define RACI, OKRs and governance cadence  
   • RACI chart that spells out who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted and Informed for each workstream (e.g., pricing approval, channel partner selection, local compliance).  
   • Quarterly OKRs (Objectives & Key Results) tied to entry-specific milestones: prototype launch, first 100 customers, channel onboarding, breakeven point.  
   • Weekly or bi-weekly steering meetings to review progress, resolve blockers, allocate resources and de-risk.  

4. Align incentives and performance metrics  
   • Tie compensation and bonuses to the entry OKRs and to cross-functional outcomes, not just individual or siloed KPIs.  
   • Introduce “team” stretch goals—if Marketing hits its lead target and Sales hits its conversion target, everybody shares an extra equity pool or bonus.  

5. Create transparent, real-time communication channels  
   • Use a shared dashboard (e.g., in your BI tool or project management platform) so every function can see lead gen, pipeline, product development status, P&L burn, regulatory approvals.  
   • Daily or weekly stand-ups by workstream, plus a rotating “deep dive” each week in the executive team meeting.  
   • Town halls or all-hands updates every month to reinforce purpose, celebrate quick wins and air challenges.

6. Empower teams and remove blockers  
   • I personally serve as the escalation point for regulatory, capital or strategic decisions that threaten timelines.  
   • Encourage “micro-task forces” or tiger teams that cut across functions to solve high-impact problems quickly.  
   • Delegate decision rights aggressively but keep a clear escalation path so teams can move fast without getting stuck in red tape.

7. Foster a culture of shared ownership and recognition  
   • Celebrate early victories publicly—first pilot customer, first regulatory sign-off, first deal signed.  
   • Rotate team members through “war room” or immersion sessions to build empathy for other functions.  
   • Solicit feedback in real time (“What’s slowing you down?”) and act on it visibly so people see their input drive change.

8. Iterate based on market feedback  
   • Launch minimum-viable pilot quickly, gather local customer and channel partner feedback, then refine product positioning, pricing or support model.  
   • Share learnings transparently so that Marketing, R&D and Operations all update their plans in sync.  

By coupling a crystal-clear strategic narrative with disciplined governance, aligned incentives, open communication and an “all hands on deck” culture, a CEO can ensure that diverse teams not only understand the market-entry plan, but feel personally invested in—and accountable for—its success.
