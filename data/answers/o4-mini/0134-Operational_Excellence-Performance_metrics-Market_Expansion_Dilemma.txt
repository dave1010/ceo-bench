I would prioritize defending and strengthening our core markets while carving out a lean, rapid‐test “new‐markets” cell. Here’s the decisive plan:

1. Defend and deepen our core (≈80% of resources)  
   • Rapid Customer Win-Back and Retention Sprint  
     – Double down on our highest-margin segments with targeted promotions, loyalty incentives and service guarantees.  
     – Launch a six-week “Voice of the Customer” blitz to uncover churn drivers and immediate upsell opportunities.  
   • Margin and Cost Optimization  
     – Freeze noncritical hires and discretionary spend. Redirect savings into marketing, R&D and customer-success efforts that protect revenue.  
   • Product and Brand Differentiation  
     – Fast-track three feature enhancements that neutralize the competitors’ primary value propositions.  
     – Roll out a refreshed “best-in-class” campaign to reinforce our leadership positioning.

2. Pilot new-market expansion (≈20% of resources)  
   • Lean, Cross-Functional “Market Discovery Lab”  
     – Assign a small team of marketing, biz‐dev and product talent to evaluate two highest-potential geographies or verticals.  
     – Set clear entry metrics (unit economics, customer acquisition cost, regulatory hurdles) and a 4–6-month go/no-go decision point.  
   • Minimum Viable Footprint  
     – Begin with digital inbound channels or partnership agreements rather than full P&L setups.  
     – Use agile sprints to test messaging, pricing and distribution before scaling.

3. Govern with clarity and speed  
   • Weekly “Core vs. Growth” dashboard reviewed by the Executive Committee: market share trends, pilot KPIs, margin impact and cash-burn rate.  
   • Pre-defined escalation triggers—e.g., if a pilot market reaches 80% of target ROI in month four, we automatically reallocate an additional 10% of resources to scale it.

Why this approach works  
• It secures our primary revenue engine and protects margin first—avoiding a slow bleed in markets we already dominate.  
• It preserves optionality on expansion without diluting our competitive moat.  
• Clear, time-boxed pilots and governance ensure we don’t chase shiny new markets indefinitely or miss critical early warning signs.

In short: we defend decisively, optimize ruthlessly, and experiment judiciously—so we remain rock-solid today and strategically ready for tomorrow.
