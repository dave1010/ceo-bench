As CEO, I would take the following decisive steps to eliminate any appearance of favoritism and preserve the integrity of our procurement process:

1. Immediate Disclosure  
   • I would formally disclose my personal relationship with the bidder to the Board of Directors and to our Legal & Compliance team.  
   • This disclosure would be documented in writing and entered into our conflict-of-interest register.

2. Full Recusal  
   • I would remove myself entirely from all stages of the RFP evaluation and contract-award process.  
   • I would delegate all responsibilities for this contract to a pre-appointed, independent committee of senior executives and an external procurement advisor.

3. Impartial, Standards-Based Evaluation  
   • The evaluation committee would apply the exact same scoring criteria—price competitiveness, technical capability, track record, financial strength—as for every other bidder.  
   • We would ensure at least three qualified bids are reviewed, and all bids are evaluated in parallel.

4. Transparent Oversight and Documentation  
   • Every meeting, presentation, scoring sheet and recommendation would be minuted and shared with the full Board Procurement Subcommittee.  
   • An independent internal‐audit review would sign off on the fairness and completeness of the process before any contract is awarded.

5. Board Approval and Public Disclosure  
   • The committee’s recommendation would go to the full Board for final approval, with me abstaining from the vote.  
   • Once approved, we would issue a public statement confirming that the contract was awarded through a fully transparent, arms-length process.

Why this course of action?  
• It removes me from any real or perceived influence.  
• It ensures the winning bid is chosen strictly on merit and alignment with our strategic needs.  
• It preserves stakeholder trust—employees, investors, regulators and the marketplace—all of whom expect the highest standards of corporate governance.  

By disclosing the relationship, recusing myself, and insisting on an external, documented audit trail, we protect both the company’s interests and our reputation for fairness.
