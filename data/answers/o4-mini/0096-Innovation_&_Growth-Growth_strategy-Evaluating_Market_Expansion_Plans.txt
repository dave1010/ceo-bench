A CEO’s job isn’t simply to chase every “hot” idea, but to build a repeatable, disciplined way of finding, sizing and sequencing the few new markets that will move the needle on long-term value.  Below is a high-level playbook most CEOs follow to assess and prioritize new opportunities for sustainable growth:

1. Clarify Strategic Frame  
   • Revisit the company’s North Star (vision, mission, core competencies, and purpose)  
   • Define the investment horizon (Horizon 1: defend core; Horizon 2: expand adjacencies; Horizon 3: explore new bets)  

2. Screen & Filter  
   • Macro-environment scan (PESTEL, global trade, regulatory, technology trends)  
   • Portfolio map (existing businesses vs. adjacent or transformational)  
   • “Must-have” filters (e.g. market size > $X bn; growth rate > Y%; regulatory feasibility; minimum acceptable margin)  

3. Quantify Market Attractiveness  
   • Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM) and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)  
   • Growth trajectory, competitive intensity (Porter’s Five Forces), and customer willingness to pay  
   • Profit pools and business model scalability  

4. Assess Internal Fit & Risk  
   • Capability gap analysis (R&D, sales channels, supply chain, technology)  
   • Resource requirements (capital, talent, partnerships) and opportunity cost vs. defending core business  
   • Key risks (regulatory, geopolitical, execution, currency, ESG) and mitigation plans  

5. Build the Business Case  
   • High-level P&L, cash-flow and risk-adjusted NPV or IRR  
   • Scenario planning (best, base, worst)  
   • Pilot/Kick-starter design or fast-follower strategy to test assumptions  

6. Prioritize via a Scoring Model  
   • Weighted-criteria matrix: strategic fit, value potential, speed to market, ease of execution, risk level  
   • Rank opportunities:  
      – A-bets (high value, low risk, quick wins)  
      – B-bets (solid value but require capability building)  
      – C-bets (transformational but high risk or longer horizon)  

7. Resource Allocation & Stage-Gate Governance  
   • Set clear stage-gate milestones (proof of concept, MVP, scale-up)  
   • Assign cross-functional sponsorship and accountability  
   • Tie funding to milestone reviews—re-allocate capital as learnings emerge  

8. Institutionalize the Feedback Loop  
   • Agile performance dashboards and leading KPIs (customer acquisition cost, adoption rates, churn, unit economics)  
   • Quarterly strategy reviews to re-score and re-prioritize the pipeline  
   • Lessons-learned forums to capture best practices and update the screening criteria  

By embedding this structured, data-driven process into the leadership rhythm, the CEO ensures that new market entries aren’t one-off gambles but deliberate, continuously optimized drivers of sustainable, long-term growth.
