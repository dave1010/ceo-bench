To make sure strategic priorities “stick” and become part of everyday life at the company, a CEO typically works across four broad levers—clarity & communication, governance & metrics, leadership behaviors & talent systems, and culture-building rituals.  Here’s how those play out in practice:

1. Clarity and Consistent Communication  
   • Define and codify the strategy in simple, memorable terms (e.g., a one-page strategy map, three strategic pillars, a “North Star” metric).  
   • Cascade it everywhere—CEO all-hands, leadership team offsites, town halls, newsletters, intranet.  
   • Translate corporate priorities into team- and individual-level objectives so each manager and employee can see how their day-to-day work links to the big picture.

2. Governance, Metrics, and Accountability  
   • Embed strategic KPIs into the monthly/quarterly business-review cadence so every operating review begins with, “How are we tracking on our key priorities?”  
   • Tie resource allocation (budgeting, head-count decisions, capital investments) explicitly to strategic objectives.  
   • Hold each leadership layer accountable through scorecards or “balanced pays” where part of compensation is at risk based on progress against strategic targets.

3. Leading by Example and Talent Systems  
   • Demonstrate the behaviors you want to see—if “customer obsession” is a pillar, the CEO meets key clients personally, celebrates customer success stories, and insists on customer-centric metrics in Board decks.  
   • Recruit, promote, and retain leaders whose strengths and track records map directly to the strategic priorities.  
   • Build those priorities into performance reviews, career paths, and incentive plans so employees know that delivering on strategy is how you “get ahead.”

4. Culture-Building Rituals and Storytelling  
   • Celebrate early wins and “heroes” who exemplify strategic behaviors—publicly recognize teams that solved problems in new ways aligned with the strategy.  
   • Preserve and retell stories about how the strategy came to life: Lessons learned, pivot moments, customer impacts.  
   • Create recurring rituals (quarterly innovation fairs, hackathons, “demo days,” strategy immersion workshops) that reinforce why and how the strategic priorities matter.

5. Continuous Learning and Adjustment  
   • Solicit bottom-up feedback on what’s working or not—surveys, skip-level meetings, action-planning workshops—and be willing to refine processes or even elements of the strategy.  
   • Invest in training and capability building to close gaps (for example, digital upskilling if digital transformation is a strategic pillar).  
   • Model a test-and-learn mindset: pilot new approaches, measure rigorously, scale what works and decommission what doesn’t.

By relentlessly applying these levers—communicating clearly, hard-wiring priorities into governance and incentives, walking the talk as a leader, celebrating the culture you want, and iterating based on feedback—the CEO ensures that the strategy isn’t just words on a slide but the operating rhythm and backbone of the company’s culture.
