A CEO’s goal in allocating scarce capital is always the same: deploy it where it will earn the highest risk-adjusted returns over time and/or advance the company’s strategic objectives, thereby driving sustainable growth in per-share value.  In practice that means putting in place a consistent, disciplined process to evaluate, rank and fund every use of capital—internal projects, acquisitions, buybacks, dividends or debt pay-down—and then holding each allocation accountable for delivering the promised returns.

Here is a typical five-step approach:

1. Define the strategic framework and financial hurdles  
   • Clarify your top strategic priorities (e.g., core-business reinvestment, new markets, technology leadership).  
   • Establish minimum return thresholds tied to the company’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC), adjusted for project risk (higher hurdle for riskier bets).

2. Generate and vet capital proposals  
   • Require every major project to submit a business case with key metrics: net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), payback period, margin contribution, strategic fit, and key risks.  
   • Include “off-ramps” or stage-gates so that projects get incremental funding only as they clear milestones.

3. Rank competing requests on a common basis  
   • Create a “capital scorecard” that weights financial returns, strategic alignment, risk profile, resource requirements and timing.  
   • Stress-test assumptions with sensitivity and scenario analyses (e.g., commodity swings, regulatory changes).

4. Allocate the scarce pool of capital  
   • First fund the projects with the highest risk-adjusted returns that also advance the strategy.  
   • Then consider alternative uses of cash—share buybacks if stock is undervalued, dividends for mature cash cows, debt reduction if leverage is above target, or acquisitions for adjacency growth.  
   • Maintain flexibility—reserve a buffer for opportunistic investments or downturns.

5. Rigorously monitor, re-prioritize and recycle capital  
   • Hold project leaders to agreed milestones and financial targets; reallocate funding away from underperformers.  
   • Conduct periodic portfolio reviews; harvest gains and redeploy cash from lower-return activities into higher-return initiatives.  
   • Communicate results to the board and investors in terms of value created (e.g., IRR vs. hurdle, incremental free cash flow, total shareholder return impact).

By applying this discipline—tying every dollar to a clear, risk-adjusted return expectation, insisting on strategic relevance, and enforcing stage-gate accountability—the CEO ensures capital flows to the highest-value opportunities, continuously optimizing the portfolio and maximizing long-term shareholder value.
