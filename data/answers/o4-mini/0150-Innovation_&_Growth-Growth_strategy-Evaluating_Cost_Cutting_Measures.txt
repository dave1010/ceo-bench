I would launch a two-track “Profit with Promise” initiative:  

1. Targeted Cost Optimization  
   • Zero-Based Budgeting in Corporate & Overhead – Start each function at a clean slate, justify every expense, and redeploy savings to high-value areas.  
   • Lean Process & Automation – Map our end-to-end workflows, eliminate non-value–adding steps, and invest in robotics/AI tools for routine back-office work.  
   • Strategic Sourcing & SKU Rationalization – Renegotiate key supplier contracts for volume discounts, and trim low-margin or low-volume SKUs that dilute operational focus.  

2. Value-Preserving Investment  
   • Protect R&D and Customer-Facing Budgets – Ring-fence funding for product innovation, quality assurance, and frontline service training. Cutting here would erode our brand and long-term revenues.  
   • Voice-of-Customer Metrics – Tie all cost-savings proposals to projected NPS/CSAT impacts. Any idea forecast to pull NPS down by more than 0.5 points must be reworked or rejected.  
   • Cross-Functional Governance – Convene a weekly review board (Finance + Ops + Product + Marketing) to validate that savings measures don’t undermine customer value.  

Why this works:  
• Discipline without Indiscriminate Cuts – Zero-based budgeting forces rigor but channels savings to growth drivers, not simply across-the-board layoffs.  
• Technology Leverage – Automation reduces cost and error rates, improving quality at lower spend.  
• Continuous Customer Safeguards – Embedding NPS/CSAT as “stop lights” keeps us honest: saving costs never becomes more important than solving actual customer needs.  

With clear accountability and real-time metrics, we’ll drive mid-teens improvement in operating margin over 12–18 months—while preserving (and in some cases enhancing) the product quality and customer experience that underpin our brand.
