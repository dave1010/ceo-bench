As CEO, I’m choosing to invest in efficiency improvements rather than pursue broad layoffs. Here’s why and how we’ll execute:

1. Preserve Critical Talent and Morale  
   • Our people drive innovation—indiscriminate cuts would cripple our capacity to develop better products and processes.  
   • By avoiding mass layoffs, we maintain institutional knowledge and keep teams focused on solving the root cost problems, not just surviving them.

2. Targeted, Data-Driven Cost-Reduction Program  
   • Launch a cross-functional “Cost Efficiency Task Force” with representatives from Operations, Finance, Supply Chain and IT.  
   • Map our end-to-end production processes to identify high-impact waste and bottlenecks—whether in materials, labor utilization or energy consumption.  
   • Prioritize “quick wins” (e.g., renegotiating key supplier contracts, optimizing shift patterns) that can yield 5–7% cost savings in the next 6 months.

3. Strategic Investments for Sustainable Gains  
   • Allocate a one-time, 3%-of-revenue fund toward automation, lean manufacturing training and digital process controls.  
   • Roll out pilot projects—robotic material handling, real-time production dashboards, predictive maintenance—to deliver a 10–15% reduction in unit costs over 12–18 months.  
   • Use the savings generated by these pilots to scale successful initiatives company-wide.

4. Measured Workforce Alignment  
   • We will not implement blanket layoffs. Instead, we’ll manage any headcount adjustments through voluntary programs, natural attrition and redeployments into growth areas.  
   • Any involuntary reductions will be tightly targeted to roles truly rendered redundant by process improvements—and only after we’ve exhausted retraining and relocation options.

5. Financial and Performance Guardrails  
   • Establish clear KPIs—unit cost per product, on-time delivery rates, labor productivity—and tie 25% of senior management bonuses to hitting these targets.  
   • Review progress monthly with the Board and adjust course rapidly if projects aren’t delivering the expected ROI.

By choosing long-term efficiency investments over blunt headcount cuts, we’ll lower our cost structure sustainably, protect our innovative capacity and emerge more competitive—while still delivering the near-term savings our shareholders and stakeholders demand.
