A CEO under fire in a crisis can still steer the ship according to the company’s deepest convictions. Here’s how she keeps values front and center, even when the heat is on:

1. Ground Every Choice in a Values‐Based Filter  
   • She begins by asking, “Does this decision honor our core commitments—integrity, respect, stewardship?”  
   • If an option passes the “Would I still be proud of it if it went on the front page?” test, it stays in play; if not, it goes back to the drawing board.

2. Bring Transparency and Candor to Stakeholder Communication  
   • She lays out the challenges, trade-offs and data candidly to employees, investors, customers and the board.  
   • By sharing the “why” behind painful steps (e.g. furloughs, budget cuts), she preserves trust and invites constructive feedback.

3. Consult and Empower an Ethics “Reality Check”  
   • In real time she taps an internal ethics council or external advisors to vet wrenching choices against company principles and legal standards.  
   • That formal checkpoint prevents gut-punch decisions made in isolation or panic.

4. Model Sacrifice and Fairness in Hard-ship Sharing  
   • Before asking line managers and front-line staff to sacrifice, she publicly forgoes her own bonus or takes a reduction in pay.  
   • She applies cuts, incentives or redeployments consistently—no special carve-outs for insiders.

5. Own the Outcome and Adjust Course  
   • She holds herself accountable for both intended and unintended consequences, communicating lessons learned.  
   • As conditions evolve, she revisits earlier decisions through the same values filter, showing that ethics isn’t a one-and-done checkbox but a living discipline.

By relentlessly applying these practices—values-based filters, transparent communication, ethical vetting, shared sacrifice and adaptive accountability—a CEO proves that even in crisis, doing the right thing need not be sidelined.
