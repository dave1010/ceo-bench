I’d resolve this by putting in place a structured, time-boxed integration plan that balances culture preservation with the clear need for efficiency.  Here’s my decision as CEO:

1. Launch a 90-day “Dual-Track Integration”  
   • Create an Integration Management Office (IMO) led by a senior executive with equal reporting lines into both legacy CEOs.  
   • During this period, commercial, product, and customer-facing teams remain under their existing leadership to protect brand promise, customer relationships, and employee morale.  
   • Back-office functions—finance, HR, IT and procurement—move immediately into a unified leadership team to begin realizing cost and process synergies.

2. Execute a rigorous cultural-and-performance assessment  
   • After 90 days, the IMO presents a data-driven report on overlap, operational KPIs, and culture-health indicators (engagement surveys, turnover, customer feedback).  
   • This creates a neutral fact base to decide exactly which legacy roles can be consolidated, redefined, or phased out.

3. Transition to a single leadership team by month six  
   • Based on the IMO’s findings, we reorganize into one leadership structure with clear owners for every critical function.  
   • We offer tailored change-management and coaching for impacted leaders, plus retention packages for top talent.  
   • We codify new cultural norms—shared values, operating principles, decision rights—to reinforce unity.

Why this approach?  
• It answers the board’s call for efficiency immediately by combining back-office functions.  
• It reassures those who worry about cultural loss by respecting customer-facing teams through an initial carve-out.  
• It converts opinion into objective data, minimizing politics and bias in our final leadership realignment.  
• It sets clear deadlines and deliverables—no open-ended debates—and holds everyone accountable for hitting integration milestones.

By proceeding in this phased, data-led way, we strike the optimal balance between preserving what works in each legacy company and moving swiftly toward the streamlined, unified organization our shareholders expect.
