I would move immediately to a phased, risk-based compliance program that protects the company from regulatory fines and reputation damage while preserving runway for our strategic growth initiatives.  

1. Conduct a Rapid Risk Assessment      • Within the next two weeks, have our IT and legal teams map out the three highest-risk data flows and pinpoint any critical gaps versus the new regulations.      • Estimate both the one-time capital expense and ongoing operating expense needed to close those gaps.  

2. Reallocate and Phase Capital      • Reprioritize existing IT capital: defer lower-impact projects (e.g., non-urgent application upgrades) and redirect about 60 percent of that budget to shore up the highest-risk controls.      • Phase remaining compliance items over 12 months. This spreads cost, eases cash flow pressure, and aligns training waves with each roll-out.  

3. Leverage Managed Services and Cloud Partners      • Where we can, shift to cloud or managed-security services to convert big up-front investments into predictable opex.      • Negotiate multi-year deals with key providers to lock in volume discounts and SLA commitments on data-protection tooling.  

4. Targeted, Role-Based Training    • Develop a concise “data protection boot camp” for high-exposure teams (IT, HR, finance, customer support) first, then cascade to all employees over six months.      • Use a blend of on-demand e-learning and quarterly live workshops to keep costs down and reinforce behavior.  

5. Monitor ROI and Adjust    • Establish monthly dashboards tracking:        – Compliance score for each business unit        – Actual vs. budgeted spend on controls and training        – Incident reports and near-misses      • At each quarter-end, review performance, adjust funding levels, and rephase lower-risk activities if cash flow becomes tight.  

Why this approach?  
• It neutralizes the most severe regulatory and reputational risks within 60 days.  
• It smooths cash-flow impact by phasing noncritical investments and leveraging opex models.  
• It aligns spending with demonstrable risk reduction and business value, ensuring that every dollar we invest directly protects our customers, our brand, and our balance sheet.
