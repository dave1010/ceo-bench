I’m declining to move forward with the deal in its current form—but not because I’m blind to the upside. We will only partner if the vendor meets three non-negotiable conditions up front:

1. Full ethics audit by an approved third party.  We commission an independent review of their past practices, supply chain and labour standards, and publish a summary to our board and key stakeholders.

2. Binding Code-of-Conduct addendum.  They must sign our standard ethics covenant—mirroring our own policies on anti-corruption, human rights, data privacy and environmental impact—and agree to quarterly compliance reporting.

3. Joint governance and enforcement.  We’ll embed our compliance officers on their team, share real-time monitoring data, and retain the right to suspend or terminate the relationship immediately if violations recur.

If they accept and pass the audit within 60 days, we’ll proceed—unlocking the projected revenue and market share gains while preserving our reputation and values. If they refuse or fail, we walk away and redirect our resources toward alternative, values-aligned partners or organic growth initiatives. 

That way we remain true to our ethical commitments, protect brand equity, and still keep the door open to substantial upside—provided it’s built on a solid foundation of integrity.
