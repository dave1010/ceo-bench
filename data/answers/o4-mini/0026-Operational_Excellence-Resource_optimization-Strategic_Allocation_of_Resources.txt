Here’s a structured evaluation you can adapt for your CEO‐Bench response:

1. Overall Rating (1–5)  
   • 5 – Exceptionally effective  
   • 4 – Very effective  
   • 3 – Moderately effective  
   • 2 – Somewhat ineffective  
   • 1 – Ineffective  

2. Rationale for the Rating  
   • Clarity of Strategic Priorities  
     – Does the CEO articulate a small number (3–5) of top‐priority goals with clear, measurable outcomes?  
   • Budgeting & Resource Allocation Process  
     – Is there a formal, transparent process (annual budget + rolling forecasts) that ties funding and head count to those priorities?  
   • Ongoing Review & Rebalancing  
     – Are resources (people, capital, tech) regularly reallocated based on performance data and changing market conditions?  
   • Cross‐Functional Alignment  
     – Does the CEO break down silos by convening cross‐departmental forums to resolve conflicts over scarce resources?  
   • Accountability & Metrics  
     – Do leaders have scorecards that link their unit’s KPIs back to strategic objectives—and face real consequences if targets aren’t met?

3. Example Strengths (if you rated 4–5)  
   • The CEO drove a zero‐based budgeting exercise that freed up 15% of the R&D budget for high-priority innovation projects.  
   • Quarterly portfolio‐review meetings surface underperformers and enable swift redeployment of talent and capital.  
   • Investment in a dashboard tied every line-item spend to one of the company’s five strategic pillars, boosting transparency and cutting non-strategic spend by 20%.

4. Example Gaps (if you rated 2–3)  
   • Resource requests outside core priorities sometimes get “fast-tracked” without clear ROI criteria.  
   • Silos persist—marketing and product teams compete for the same head count, slowing down execution.  
   • Mid-year reallocations happen informally, causing confusion over who owns which budget.

5. Recommendations for Improvement  
   • Formalize a rolling reforecast process (e.g., quarterly “resource rebalancing” reviews)  
   • Introduce a clear decision-rights framework—who decides when to deploy extra capital or shift head count  
   • Tie 20–30% of senior leaders’ compensation to the successful realignment of resources behind top strategic goals  
   • Deploy a portfolio-management tool that visually maps current investments against strategic priorities

Using that structure, you can succinctly justify your rating and show how well (or poorly) the CEO aligns resources to strategic aims to drive productivity and impact.
