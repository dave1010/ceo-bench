**Confidential Internal Communication:**

Dear Valued Colleagues,

As we navigate the evolving business landscape and strive to maintain our competitive edge, we have made the difficult decision to undergo a structural reduction of 10% of our workforce. This decision was not taken lightly, and I want to emphasize that it is entirely necessary to ensure our long-term sustainability and growth.

I want to assure you that we are committed to supporting those who will be leaving us and providing a comprehensive separation package that includes outplacement assistance and career counseling. Their contributions will undoubtedly be missed, and we appreciate the dedication and hard work they have shown during their time with our organization.

For those who will remain, I want to reassure you that we value your commitment and dedication. We are committed to maintaining a positive and healthy work environment, and I want to assure you that we will continue to invest in your development and growth as we navigate this change. We will be providing additional support, including enhanced training and mentorship opportunities, to help you continue to excel in your roles.

This reduction will not affect our core mission and values, and we will continue to operate with the same level of excellence and service that our customers expect from us. We will also continue to recognize and reward outstanding performance, and we will maintain our commitment to recognizing and celebrating your achievements.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to your manager or HR representative. We will be hosting town hall meetings and Q&A sessions to address any questions and provide updates on this process.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation during this transition. Your dedication and resilience are what make our organization strong, and we will continue to thrive together.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
CEO
