As the CEO, I would identify, evaluate, and mitigate strategic risks that could impact the company's future stability through a multi-step process involving continuous monitoring, risk assessment, and mitigation strategies.

**Identification of Strategic Risks:**

1. **Establish a Risk Management Framework**: Develop and implement a comprehensive risk management framework that integrates risk management into the company's strategic planning process.
2. **Conduct Regular Risk Assessments**: Regularly assess the company's risk profile, including market risks, operational risks, regulatory risks, and reputational risks.
3. **Engage Stakeholders**: Engage with stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, and partners, to gather insights and perspectives on potential risks.
4. **Review Industry Trends and Market Analysis**: Stay up-to-date with industry trends and market analysis to identify potential risks and opportunities.

**Evaluation of Strategic Risks:**

1. **Assess Severity and Probability**: Evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of each identified risk, categorizing them as high, medium, or low risk.
2. **Consider the Company's Tolerance Level**: Consider the company's risk tolerance and its willingness to take on risk.
3. **Evaluate Business Impact**: Assess the potential business impact of each risk, including financial, operational, and reputational implications.

**Mitigation of Strategic Risks:**

1. **Risk Avoidance**: Identify ways to avoid or mitigate risks, such as through diversification or hedging strategies.
2. **Risk Transfer**: Consider transferring risks to third parties, such as through insurance or outsourcing.
3. **Risk Acceptance**: Develop a plan to accept and manage risks, including setting aside resources for potential losses.
4. **Risk Reduction**: Implement measures to reduce the likelihood or impact of risks, such as through process improvements or investments in new technology.
5. **Establish a Risk Governance Framework**: Establish a risk governance framework that outlines responsibilities, authorities, and accountabilities for risk management.
6. **Develop Crisis Management Plans**: Develop crisis management plans to prepare for potential risks, including communication protocols and response strategies.
7. **Monitor and Review**: Regularly monitor and review the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies and update them as necessary.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:

1. **Risk-Adjusted Return on Capital (RORC)**: Use RORC to measure the company's return on investment, adjusted for the level of risk.
2. **Risk Profile**: Track the company's risk profile and adjust it as necessary to ensure alignment with the company's risk tolerance.
3. **Risk Management Budget**: Establish a risk management budget to allocate resources for risk mitigation and management.
4. **Risk-Related Metrics**: Track metrics such as risk exposure, risk mitigation effectiveness, and loss incidence.

**Communication and Training**:

1. **Communicate Risks to Stakeholders**: Communicate risks to stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, and partners, to ensure transparency and alignment.
2. **Train Employees**: Provide training to employees on risk management and mitigation strategies to ensure they are equipped to manage risks effectively.

By following this structured approach, I, as the CEO, can confidently identify, evaluate, and mitigate strategic risks that could impact the company's future stability, ensuring the company remains resilient and adaptable in a rapidly changing business environment.
