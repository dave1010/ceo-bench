To effectively identify and prioritize cost-saving opportunities within an organization, the CEO can follow a structured approach:

1. **Establish a data-driven culture**: Ensure that the organization collects and analyzes relevant financial and operational data on a regular basis. This will enable the CEO to make informed decisions based on facts rather than assumptions.

2. **Conduct thorough cost audits**: Conduct comprehensive reviews of all operational costs, including personnel, equipment, maintenance, and other expenses. This will help identify areas where costs can be reduced without compromising the organization's objectives.

3. **Develop a long-term vision**: Set clear and measurable long-term goals for the organization. This will enable the CEO to identify which cost-saving opportunities align with the organization's strategic objectives.

4. **Form a cross-functional cost-saving committee**: Assemble a diverse team consisting of personnel from various departments and levels of the organization. This will bring together different perspectives and ensure that all departments are on board with cost-saving initiatives.

5. **Use the Pareto analysis**: The Pareto analysis, also known as the 80/20 rule, identifies the 20% of costs that contribute to 80% of the total expenses. Focus on eliminating or significantly reducing this high-impact cost segment to achieve the greatest impact.

6. **Explore process improvements**: Analyze operational processes to identify opportunities for streamlining and automating tasks. This can lead to reduced labor and resource costs.

7. **Leverage technology**: Implement cost-saving tools, software, and platforms to enhance productivity and efficiency.

8. **Consider strategic partnerships or outsourcing**: Explore partnering with other organizations or outsourcing non-core functions to reduce costs and improve focus on core activities.

9. **Implement cost-saving tracking and monitoring**: Set up a framework for tracking cost-saving progress against predetermined targets. Monitor the impact of implemented cost-saving initiatives and adjust as needed.

10. **Maintain transparency and involvement**: Ensure that the entire organization understands the reasoning behind cost-saving decisions and the strategies in place to achieve them.

When prioritizing cost-saving opportunities, the CEO should consider the following criteria:

- **Alignment with strategic objectives**: Align cost-saving initiatives with the organization's long-term goals and objectives.
- **Financial impact**: Focus on initiatives with the greatest potential for cost savings.
- **Operational impact**: Balance cost savings with the potential effects on operational performance.
- **Risk**: Minimize the potential risks associated with cost-saving initiatives, such as potential service disruptions or negative impact on stakeholder relationships.

By adopting this structured approach, the CEO can identify and prioritize cost-saving opportunities while maintaining operational effectiveness.
