To effectively answer this question, let me share my approach to leading due diligence in the M&A process as a CEO:

**Pre-Due Diligence Phase**

1. **Establish Clear Goals and Objectives**: Before initiating due diligence, I would clearly define the company's strategic objectives, target acquisition criteria, and essential key performance indicators (KPIs) for both our company and the potential acquisition target.
2. **Identify Key Stakeholders**: I would engage with key stakeholders, including the acquisition team, board members, and external advisors, to ensure everyone is aligned on the process and goals.
3. **Develop a Comprehensive Due Diligence Checklist**: I would create a comprehensive checklist to guide the due diligence process, focusing on areas such as financial performance, operational efficiency, market conditions, competition, regulatory compliance, intellectual property, and human capital.

**Due Diligence Phase**

1. **Assemble a Specialized Due Diligence Team**: I would assemble a team of experts, including financial analysts, operational consultants, lawyers, and industry specialists, to conduct the due diligence process.
2. **Review Financial Statements and Projections**: The team would thoroughly review the target company's financial statements, forecasts, and cash flows to identify potential financial risks and areas for improvement.
3. **Conduct Operational and Regulatory Due Diligence**: We would assess the target company's operational efficiency, management structure, regulatory compliance, and risk management practices to identify areas for improvement.
4. **Examine Market and Competitive Conditions**: We would analyze the target company's market position, competition, and growth opportunities to understand its potential for growth and profitability.
5. **Evaluate Intellectual Property and Technology**: We would assess the target company's intellectual property portfolio, technology infrastructure, and research and development capabilities to ensure alignment with our company's goals.
6. **Review Human Capital and Talent**: We would evaluate the target company's human capital, including its talent pool, employee morale, and organizational structure, to ensure alignment with our company's culture and values.

**Post-Due Diligence Phase**

1. **Analyze and Synthesize Findings**: We would analyze and synthesize the findings from the due diligence process to identify key value drivers and potential risks.
2. **Negotiate Deal Terms and Conditions**: Based on our findings, we would negotiate the deal terms and conditions with the target company, including price, structure, and governance arrangements.
3. **Establish a Transition Plan**: We would develop a transition plan to ensure a seamless integration of the target company into our organization.

By following this structured approach to leading due diligence, I believe I can effectively identify key value drivers and potential risks during the M&A process, ultimately making informed decisions that drive business growth and value creation.
