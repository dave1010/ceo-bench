To answer this question, I'll walk through the key strategies I'd implement to actively encourage and embed innovation within the organizational culture:

1. **Establish a Culture of Experimentation**: Encourage employees to test new ideas, take calculated risks, and learn from failures. We'd create a safe and empowering environment where experimentation is celebrated and valued.

2. **Foster Collaboration Across Disciplines**: Bring together teams from diverse backgrounds and functions to tackle complex problems. This will enable us to leverage unique skill sets, generate novel solutions, and drive business growth.

3. **Emphasize Continuous Learning and Development**: Provide resources, training, and workshops to foster ongoing learning and growth. This includes access to emerging technologies, industry trends, and mentorship programs to stay ahead of the curve.

4. **Set Ambitious Goals and Metrics**: Establish clear, ambitious targets for innovation and creativity and tie them to company-wide goals. This will foster a sense of purpose, urgency, and accountability.

5. **Empower Employee Ownership and Autonomy**: Give teams ownership of their projects and provide them with autonomy to make decisions. This will encourage innovation, accountability, and a sense of purpose.

6. **Create a Feedback Loop**: Establish a culture of feedback, both positive and constructive, to continually refine and improve our innovation framework.

7. **Recognize and Reward Innovation**: Celebrate and recognize employee contributions, ideas, and successes that drive innovation and growth. This will foster a culture of innovation and inspire others to follow suit.

8. **Develop and Utilize Innovation Tools and Techniques**: Leverage agile methodologies, design thinking, lean startup principles, and other tools to streamline innovation processes and accelerate growth.

9. **Develop Strategic Partnerships**: Collaborate with external innovation partners, incubators, accelerators, and research institutions to bring in fresh perspectives, expertise, and access to emerging trends.

10. **Monitor and Track Innovation Performance**: Regularly assess and measure innovation performance, using metrics that reflect our business objectives and innovation goals. This will enable us to course-correct and optimize our strategy.

By implementing these strategies, I believe we can create an organizational culture that encourages and embeds innovation, driving ongoing creativity and adaptability to achieve business growth and success.
