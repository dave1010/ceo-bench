When considering entering a new international market, the following key criteria should be prioritized to ensure alignment with our company's strategic goals:

1. **Market Size and Growth Potential**  
   Prioritizing markets with substantial size and strong growth potential aligns with objectives of scaling revenue and expanding market share. Entering a rapidly growing market increases the opportunity for sustainable long-term profitability.

2. **Strategic Fit with Core Competencies**  
   The market should complement our company’s strengths—whether in product offerings, technology, or operational capabilities—to maximize competitive advantage and ensure effective execution.

3. **Competitive Landscape**  
   Understanding the intensity and nature of competition helps assess market entry risk and required investment. Favorable competitive dynamics provide a clearer path to differentiation and leadership.

4. **Regulatory and Political Environment**  
   Stability in political and regulatory frameworks reduces risk and potential costs related to compliance, tariffs, or sudden policy changes, protecting our investments and operational continuity.

5. **Cultural and Consumer Behavior Alignment**  
   The local consumer preferences and cultural norms should be compatible with our brand and product value proposition to facilitate market acceptance and brand loyalty.

6. **Economic and Currency Stability**  
   Entering markets with stable economic conditions and manageable currency risks safeguards profitability and financial planning.

7. **Operational and Logistical Feasibility**  
   Accessibility in terms of supply chain, distribution channels, and local partnerships ensures smoother market entry and fulfillment capabilities.

Prioritizing these criteria helps ensure that market entry decisions not only expand our global footprint but also reinforce our strategic goals around sustainable growth, brand strength, and operational excellence.
