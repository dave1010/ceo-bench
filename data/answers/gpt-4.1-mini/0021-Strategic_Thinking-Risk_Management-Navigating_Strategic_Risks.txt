   - **Risk Prioritization:** The CEO leads or commissions risk assessments to evaluate the likelihood and potential impact of identified risks, focusing on how they could affect strategic objectives.
   - **Scenario Analysis:** Employs scenario planning to understand best-case, worst-case, and most likely outcomes, enabling a comprehensive view of implications.
   - **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Utilizes analytics and expert advice to quantify risks and integrate qualitative considerations, ensuring balanced evaluation.

3. **Mitigation of Strategic Risks:**
   - **Strategic Planning:** Incorporates risk mitigation strategies into the broader corporate strategy, ensuring alignment with the company’s goals and resources.
   - **Resource Allocation:** Directs investments towards innovation, diversification, or capability-building initiatives that reduce vulnerability to identified risks.
   - **Governance and Controls:** Establishes robust risk management frameworks, including clear policies, accountability mechanisms, and regular reporting structures.
