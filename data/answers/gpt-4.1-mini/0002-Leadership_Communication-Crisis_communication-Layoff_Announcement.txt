Subject: Navigating Change Together

Dear Team,

As we continue to adapt to a rapidly changing business environment, we have made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 10%. This was not taken lightly, and we are committed to supporting everyone affected through this transition.

Our priority remains building a stronger, more resilient company positioned for future success. We deeply appreciate the hard work and dedication of each team member and will strive to maintain open communication and provide the resources needed during this time.

Thank you for your continued commitment and teamwork. Together, we will move forward and emerge stronger.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]  
CEO
