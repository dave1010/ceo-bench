As the CEO, I believe that managing risks is not only a critical function, but also a key driver of sustainable growth. To evaluate and manage potential risks associated with strategic initiatives, I would employ the following course of action:

**Risk Evaluation Framework:**

1. **Identify Potential Risks**: I would assemble a cross-functional team, including key leaders, to identify potential risks associated with our strategic initiatives. We would use a structured approach to assess the likelihood and potential impact of each risk.

**Risk Management Approach:**

2. **Assess and Prioritize Risks**: Based on the evaluation, I would prioritize risks by categorizing them as high, medium, or low impact. We would then focus on mitigating the high-priority risks first, while still addressing the medium and low-priority risks to ensure that we are not neglecting any potential threats.

3. **Create a Risk Mitigation Plan**: For each high- and medium-priority risk, I would develop a mitigation plan that outlines the steps we would take to reduce the likelihood and impact of that risk. This plan would be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure we are making progress in mitigating the risk.

**Risk Management Tools:**

4. **Use Data-Driven Insights**: To inform our risk management approach, we would leverage data analytics and insights to identify patterns and trends that may indicate potential risks. This would help us to anticipate and prepare for potential risks before they materialize.

5. **Establish a Continuous Monitoring Process**: I would establish a robust monitoring process to identify and respond to new risks as they arise. This would include regular review of our risk register, updates to our mitigation plans, and communication with stakeholders to ensure everyone is aware of potential risks.

**Culture and Communication:**

6. **Foster a Risk-Aware Culture**: I would promote a risk-aware culture within our organization by communicating the importance of risk management to all employees and leaders. This would encourage individuals to identify and report potential risks, and to take ownership of mitigating those risks.

7. **Collaboration and Feedback**: I would encourage collaboration among team members to identify potential risks, and solicit feedback from stakeholders to ensure that our risk management approach is effective and aligned with organizational goals.

**Metrics and Review:**

8. **Establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: I would establish KPIs to measure the effectiveness of our risk management approach, such as the frequency and severity of risk events, the effectiveness of our mitigation plans, and the impact on our strategic initiatives.

By following this course of action, I am confident that we can effectively evaluate and manage potential risks associated with strategic initiatives, ensuring that our organization is well-positioned for sustainable growth and success.
