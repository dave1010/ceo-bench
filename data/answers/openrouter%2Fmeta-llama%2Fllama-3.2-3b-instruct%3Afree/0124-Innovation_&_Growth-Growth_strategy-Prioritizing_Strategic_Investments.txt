As the CEO, I prioritize strategic investments based on a thorough and structured evaluation process. Here's the course of action I'd take:

**Investment Prioritization Framework**

To ensure that we invest in the right opportunities to drive company growth, I'd use the following framework to evaluate potential investments:

1. **Business Case Analysis**: We'd conduct an in-depth analysis of the investment opportunity, including its potential return on investment (ROI), risk profile, and alignment with our company's strategic objectives.
2. **Market Landscape Assessment**: We'd assess the competitive landscape and the potential for disruption, as well as the market size and growth potential.
3. **Customer and Revenue Impact**: We'd evaluate how the investment would impact our customer base, revenue streams, and market share.
4. **Operational Readiness and Integration**: We'd assess the operational feasibility of the investment, including any required changes to our business model, processes, or infrastructure.
5. **Resource Allocation and ROI**: We'd consider the resource allocation and potential return on investment (ROI) required to execute the investment plan.
6. **Risk and Mitigation**: We'd identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies to ensure that the investment remains on track and aligned with our company's objectives.

**Prioritization Criteria**

Based on the investment prioritization framework, I'd use the following criteria to determine the order of investment:

1. **Strategic Fit**: Alignment with our company's strategic objectives and vision.
2. **Growth Potential**: Potential for significant revenue growth, market share gains, or competitive advantage.
3. **ROI Potential**: Expected ROI and potential for long-term returns.
4. **Risk Tolerance**: Ability to absorb and manage potential risks associated with the investment.
5. **Operational Readiness**: Feasibility of integrating the investment into our existing operations.

**Investment Decision**

After evaluating the investment opportunities and applying the prioritization criteria, I would make a decision on which strategic investments to prioritize. If multiple opportunities are competing for limited resources, I would consider a phased implementation approach to maximize the return on investment while minimizing the risk.

**Example**

For example, suppose we have three strategic investment opportunities:

1. Developing a new product line that aligns with our company's product portfolio and growth strategy, with an ROI potential of 20% per annum.
2. Investing in a new market entry, with a moderate ROI potential of 10% per annum and a higher risk profile.
3. Acquiring a complementary company to strengthen our competitive position, with a higher ROI potential of 30% per annum but a lower growth potential.

In this scenario, I would prioritize the first investment opportunity, as it aligns with our company's strategic objectives, has significant ROI potential, and operates within our current operational framework. The second and third opportunities would be considered for phased implementation or alternative funding arrangements.
