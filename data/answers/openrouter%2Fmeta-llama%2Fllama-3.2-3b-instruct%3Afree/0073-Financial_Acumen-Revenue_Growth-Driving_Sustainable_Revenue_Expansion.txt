**Answer:**

As the CEO, I recognize the importance of identifying and capitalizing on new revenue opportunities while ensuring sustainability. To achieve this, I would employ a strategic approach that combines innovation, risk management, and stakeholder engagement.

**Identifying New Revenue Opportunities:**

1. **Conduct Thorough Market Research**: Regularly engage with customers, partners, and industry experts to understand market trends, customer needs, and emerging opportunities.
2. **Analyze Competitors**: Continuously monitor competitors' strategies, strengths, and weaknesses to identify areas for differentiation and innovation.
3. **Foster a Culture of Innovation**: Encourage experimentation, calculated risk-taking, and collaboration across teams to drive creative solutions and identify new revenue streams.
4. **Leverage Emerging Technologies**: Stay ahead of the curve by embracing emerging technologies, such as AI, blockchain, and IoT, to identify potential revenue opportunities.

**Capitalizing on New Revenue Opportunities:**

1. **Develop Strategic Partnerships**: Collaborate with complementary businesses to co-create new products, services, or experiences that drive revenue growth.
2. **Diversify Product/Service Offerings**: Expand our portfolio of offerings to cater to new customer segments, industries, or geographies.
3. **Enhance Customer Engagement**: Invest in customer experience initiatives, including personalized services and tailored solutions, to drive loyalty and retention.
4. **Invest in Data-Driven Decision Making**: Leverage analytics and data analytics to inform strategic decisions and ensure data-driven decision making.

**Ensuring Sustainability:**

1. **Conduct a Comprehensive Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Evaluate the feasibility and potential impact of new revenue opportunities on our business model, financials, and sustainability metrics.
2. **Align New Initiatives with Our Core Strategy**: Ensure that any new revenue opportunities align with our company's mission, values, and long-term goals.
3. **Monitor and Report Progress**: Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress, measure impact, and adjust our strategies as needed.
4. **Foster Collaboration and Communication**: Encourage open dialogue among teams, stakeholders, and customers to ensure everyone is aligned and informed about our strategic direction and new revenue initiatives.

**Action Plan:**

To implement these strategies, I would allocate dedicated resources, including:

* Establishing a new innovation center to foster creative problem-solving and experimentation.
* Hiring experienced professionals to drive strategic partnerships and M&A activities.
* Investing in data analytics and AI tools to inform decision making and optimize our offerings.
* Developing a robust risk management framework to ensure sustainable growth while managing potential risks and challenges.

**Timeline:**

I would implement these strategies over the next 12-18 months, with the following milestones:

* Months 1-3: Develop and refine our innovation center, establish strategic partnerships, and launch a new product/service offering.
* Months 4-6: Invest in data analytics and AI tools, and establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress.
* Months 7-9: Continuously monitor and adjust our strategies based on market feedback, customer needs, and financial performance.
* Months 10-12: Evaluate the overall impact of our new revenue initiatives on our business model and sustainability metrics.

By following this strategic approach, I am confident that we can effectively identify and capitalize on new revenue opportunities while ensuring sustainability and driving long-term growth.
