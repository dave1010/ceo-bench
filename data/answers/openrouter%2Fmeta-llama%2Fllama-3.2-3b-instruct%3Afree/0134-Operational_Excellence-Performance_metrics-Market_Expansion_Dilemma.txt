As the CEO, I would take a multi-faceted approach to address the challenge of competing with aggressive expansion in new markets. While defending our current market position is crucial, I believe that investing in entering new markets is the most strategic decision. Here's why:

**Defending our current market position:**

*   We have established strong relationships with our existing customers and have a deep understanding of our current market.
*   Defending our market position would require significant investments in marketing, sales, and talent acquisition efforts, which might divert resources away from new market exploration.
*   However, if we don't act quickly to expand our presence in new markets, our competitors may capture our market share, leading to a significant loss of revenue and competitiveness.

**Investing in entering new markets:**

*   By entering new markets, we can create new revenue streams and increase our market share.
*   New markets can provide access to new customers, new products, and new opportunities for growth.
*   Investing in new markets can help us stay competitive, innovate, and maintain our position as a leader in our industry.

To approach this dilemma, I would follow a structured decision-making process:

1.  **Conduct a thorough market analysis**: Gather data on our competitors' expansion plans, market trends, customer needs, and competitor strengths and weaknesses.
2.  **Set clear goals and objectives**: Align the expansion plans with our overall business strategy and set measurable goals for market share, revenue growth, and customer acquisition.
3.  **Develop a comprehensive business plan**: Outline the resources required for expansion, the potential risks and challenges, and the expected returns on investment.
4.  **Engage with cross-functional teams**: Involve our sales, marketing, R\&D, and HR teams in the decision-making process to ensure everyone is aligned and committed to the expansion plans.
5.  **Establish clear metrics and benchmarks**: Set key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of the expansion plans, such as market share growth, customer acquisition costs, and revenue growth.

By following a structured decision-making process, I am confident that we can make a well-informed decision that prioritizes growth and expansion while maintaining our competitive edge.
