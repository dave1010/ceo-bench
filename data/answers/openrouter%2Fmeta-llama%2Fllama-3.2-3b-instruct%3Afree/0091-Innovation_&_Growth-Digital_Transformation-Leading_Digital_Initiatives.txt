**Answer:**

As the CEO, I firmly believe that effective digital transformation is essential to drive business growth, competitiveness, and sustainability. To enhance operational efficiency and customer engagement, I have chosen to implement a strategic approach that integrates digital technology across our organization.

**Course of Action:**

To steer our digital transformation efforts, I plan to implement a three-phase approach:

**Phase 1: Digital Strategy Development (Short-term, 6-9 months)**

1. **Conduct a comprehensive digital assessment**: Engage with our business units, customers, and partners to understand their digital requirements, pain points, and expectations.
2. **Define a clear digital vision and strategy**: Based on our assessment, develop a unified digital strategy that aligns with our overall business objectives and vision.
3. **Establish a digital transformation roadmap**: Prioritize initiatives, allocate resources, and set measurable targets.

**Phase 2: Digital Innovation and Implementation (Medium-term, 12-18 months)**

1. **Invest in digital innovation**: Allocate resources for R&D, innovation, and pilot projects that leverage emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, IoT, and cloud computing.
2. **Implement digital technologies**: Introduce new digital platforms, tools, and processes that enhance operational efficiency, customer engagement, and experience.
3. **Train and upskill employees**: Develop the necessary skills and knowledge to leverage new digital technologies and tools.

**Phase 3: Digital Maturity and Optimization (Long-term, 2-3 years)**

1. **Monitor and measure digital performance**: Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to track digital transformation progress, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.
2. **Continuously evaluate and optimize digital initiatives**: Assess digital investments and adjust strategies to ensure alignment with business objectives.
3. **Foster a digital-first culture**: Encourage a culture that values innovation, experimentation, and continuous learning.

**Rationale:**

To achieve successful digital transformation, we must:

1. **Align digital efforts with business objectives**: Ensure that our digital strategy supports and enhances our overall business strategy.
2. **Invest in digital innovation**: Stay ahead of the competition by embracing emerging technologies and innovation.
3. **Develop a digital-first culture**: Encourage a culture that values experimentation, learning, and continuous improvement.
4. **Monitor and measure performance**: Track digital transformation progress and make data-driven decisions to optimize our strategy.

By implementing this three-phase approach, I am confident that we can drive operational efficiency and customer engagement, ultimately enhancing our business's overall competitiveness and sustainability.
