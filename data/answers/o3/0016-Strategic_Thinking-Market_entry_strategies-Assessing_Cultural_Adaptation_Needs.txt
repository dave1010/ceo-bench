Chosen course of action  
I will institutionalize a repeatable “Cultural Intelligence (CQ) Playbook,” driven from the C-suite, that is applied to every new-market initiative. It has four gated stages—Detect, Decode, Design, Deploy—and is tied to explicit financial and brand-equity KPIs.

Why this approach works  
1. Consistency with flexibility: A single framework prevents blind spots yet still lets each country team tailor what matters locally.  
2. Speed with depth: Codified steps and pre-approved research vendors cut cycle time by ~25 %, but the mandatory in-market ethnography keeps us from relying on desktop assumptions.  
3. Ownership and accountability: Embedding P&L owners, local hires, and an external Cultural Advisory Board in every gate ensures decisions are informed and auditable. We win or lose together.

How the CQ Playbook operates  

1. Detect (0–4 weeks)  
   • Commission a “culture scan” that merges quantitative data (social listening, search trends, Nielsen, Euromonitor) with on-the-ground ethnographic interviews.  
   • Map values, taboos, usage rituals, and decision hierarchies that affect our category.  
   • Output: Heat-map of cultural friction and opportunity; go/no-go checkpoint by Executive Growth Council.

2. Decode (4–8 weeks)  
   • Form a cross-functional Market Entry Squad (marketing, product, regulatory, supply chain) led jointly by a regional GM and local cultural consultant.  
   • Translate cultural insights into business levers—product attributes, price-point psychology, purchase occasions, preferred channels.  
   • Output: “Adaptation Matrix” (what stays global vs. what must localize) ranked by ROI and risk.

3. Design (8–16 weeks)  
   • Rapid-prototype the localized offer: packaging mock-ups, UX wireframes, campaign storyboards.  
   • Run in-country consumer co-creation labs; iterate until we hit predefined acceptability scores (≥80 % purchase intent, ≤10 % cultural dissonance).  
   • Output: Final market-ready MVP, costed supply plan, localized marketing calendar.

4. Deploy (16+ weeks, ongoing)  
   • Launch under a local leader with full P&L authority, mentored by a home-office executive.  
   • All creative assets pass a “Cultural Compliance” checklist co-signed by the Legal VP and the Cultural Advisory Board.  
   • Establish a real-time dashboard: NPS, social sentiment, weekly sell-through, and any cultural controversies flagged within 24 h.

Governance and resources  
• The Chief Strategy Officer is the executive sponsor; budget ring-fenced at 1 % of projected first-year revenue for each new market.  
• Key performance bonus for the Market Entry Squad is tied 70 % to commercial targets, 30 % to cultural-fit metrics.  
• Annual post-mortems feed learnings back into the Playbook, creating a closed learning loop.

Bottom line  
By operationalizing cultural insight—rather than treating it as a “nice-to-have”—we de-risk expansion, shorten time-to-breakeven, and build a brand that feels native everywhere we go.
