Decisive course of action: I will make regulatory intelligence and compliance the very first “go / no-go” gate in every new-market plan by standing up a dedicated Regulatory Entry Task Force that reports directly to me, completes a 360° legal scan within 60 days, and delivers an executable compliance blueprint before we commit capital or sign a customer.

Why this course:

1. Protects the license to operate. A stalled launch or a fine can cost more than any marketing mis-step. Putting regulation first prevents sunk costs and reputation loss.

2. Accelerates — not delays — entry. Early, structured engagement with regulators surfaces red flags while we still have time to adapt product design, supply chain, pricing or corporate structure.

3. Creates a repeatable playbook. A single, CEO-mandated protocol across countries institutionalises knowledge, shortens future timelines, and keeps us off the “learning penalty” curve.

Key elements of the plan

1. Regulatory Entry Task Force (RET). Cross-functional (Legal, Compliance, Product, Finance, Government Affairs, ESG) led by our Chief Compliance Officer; empowered to hire local counsel and external advisors immediately.

2. 360° Scan in 60 days. Map all relevant laws: licensing, consumer protection, data/privacy, labour, trade, IP, tax, ESG, anti-bribery, import/export. Score each in terms of show-stoppers, cost, timing, probability.

3. Formal Go / No-Go Gate. RET findings are presented to the investment committee. No market move until the blueprint shows: (a) all mandatory approvals with realistic timelines; (b) quantified compliance costs; (c) mitigation plans for high-impact risks; (d) a local governance structure.

4. Early regulator engagement. Where possible we request pre-filing meetings, participate in industry consultations, and seek written guidance to lock in interpretation.

5. Product / process redesign loop. If the scan reveals friction (e.g., data-localisation), the business unit must adapt the offer or propose an alternative legal entity structure before green-lighting.

6. Budgeted compliance build-out. Allocate line items for licensing fees, local compliance hires, training, monitoring tech, and external audits; tracked in the market P&L from day one.

7. Continuous monitoring. The RET stays active for 24 months post-launch, feeds real-time legislative changes into the operating team, and triggers policy revisions or board escalations when risk thresholds are breached.

8. Accountability and culture. Compliance metrics are embedded in country GM scorecards and tied to variable pay; zero-tolerance policy for shortcuts.

By institutionalising this front-loaded, CEO-sponsored process we enter new markets faster, at lower risk, and with the credibility that regulators and customers now expect.
