My position is clear: our competitors are a free‐of‐charge R&D laboratory and an early-warning radar, not an enemy to be ignored. By studying them systematically we shorten our own learning curve, avoid costly mistakes, and spot white-space opportunities first.  

To institutionalize that mindset I have mandated three concrete practices:  

1. Formal Competitive Intelligence (CI) Sprints  
   • Every quarter a cross-functional “Red Team” (product, sales, finance, ops) is given a two-week sprint to deep-dive one priority rival.  
   • They analyze publicly available filings, pricing moves, feature releases, hiring patterns, patent filings and customer reviews.  
   • Outputs: a one-page threat/opportunity brief and a “What can we copy, leapfrog, or avoid?” decision list for the ELT.  

2. Live-Fire Win/Loss and Field Shadowing  
   • Sales and CX teams perform structured win-loss calls within ten days of every major deal. We ask prospects explicitly, “Which competitors did you compare and why did you lean their way?”  
   • Field reps shadow trade shows and webinars, capturing demo videos and messaging decks. Those assets are curated in a shared Confluence library tagged by theme (pricing, onboarding, integration, GTM motion).  

3. Product & Talent Reverse-Engineering  
   • Engineering runs periodic teardown sessions—literally buying the competitor’s product, dissecting its UX flows, architectural choices, and cost structure.  
   • HR partners with CI to map where top rival talent is congregating on LinkedIn; selective recruiting gives us both human insight and skill infusion.  

These mechanisms turn raw competitive noise into repeatable insight, feed directly into our product roadmap and GTM playbooks, and keep everyone—board to frontline—alert to shifts in the landscape.
