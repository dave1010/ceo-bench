My course of action

1. Ground the vision in fact: Before I speak a word about the future, I commission a 360° scan—market data, customer insight, technology trend-lines, competitor moves, regulatory outlook. This ensures the vision is not wishful thinking but an evidence-based reading of where value will be created over the next decade.

2. Co-create, don’t dictate: I bring the top 40 leaders, a cross-section of high-potential talent, and a customer advisory panel into a two-month “Future-Back” sprint. Together we write three scenarios, pick the most attractive one, and translate it into a single 10-year North-Star statement and three “non-negotiable” strategic choices. Involving key influencers builds ownership and surfaces blind spots early.

3. Translate vision into a three-year strategic blueprint: The long view is broken into 3-year “Strategy on a Page,” annual OKRs, and quarterly key results. Everyone can see the line of sight from their work to the North Star.

4. Communicate as a compelling story, then repeat relentlessly: I launch the vision first with the board, then with the top 200 leaders at an off-site, and within 72 hours cascade it company-wide via livestream, manager toolkits, and an interactive Q&A platform. I use vivid storytelling—customers we will serve, problems we will solve, the world we will shape—so people can see themselves in the picture. I repeat the narrative in every town hall, earnings call, and one-on-one.

5. Hard-wire it into systems and symbols: Capital allocation, M&A filters, incentive plans, leadership development, and even office design are aligned to the vision. Progress is reviewed in a quarterly “strategy health” dashboard that is shared publicly inside the company.

Why

• Fact-based + co-created = credible and embraced.  
• Storytelling + systemic reinforcement = remembered and acted upon.  
• Near-term metrics tied to a long-term North Star keep us both agile and unwavering.

This approach gives the organization a clear, inspiring, and actionable compass while ensuring we adapt quickly as the world changes.
