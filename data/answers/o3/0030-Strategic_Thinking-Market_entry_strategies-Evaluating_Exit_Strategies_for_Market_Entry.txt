CEO DECISION

We will never go into a new country without a clearly-documented EXIT PLAYBOOK that is signed off at the same time as the entry budget.  
My directive is to institutionalise the following five-step discipline:

1. Pre-Entry “Option Map”  
   • For every target market, Strategy and Finance will identify the full menu of exit/downsizing routes—sell-off, partial divestiture, JV conversion, licensing, management buy-out, orderly wind-down.  
   • Each route is scored on time-to-cash, impact on brand equity, legal complexity, and recoverable value.  
   • We treat the entry investment as a portfolio of real options, not a one-way bet.

2. Ring-fenced Legal & Capital Structure  
   • We will enter through a stand-alone SPV or JV wherever possible, capping parent-company guarantees and enabling a clean sale.  
   • All IP is kept at the group level and licensed in, so we can pull the brand/IP back instantly if we exit.

3. Trigger-Based Governance  
   • Before first euro is spent, we lock in RED-FLAG KPIs (market share, unit economics, regulatory shifts, FX bands).  
   • Three trigger levels:  
       – Watch (variance >10 %),  
       – Correct (variance >20 %, recovery plan in 30 days),  
       – Exit (variance >35 % or structural risk event).  
   • Board reviews the traffic-light dashboard quarterly; the CEO holds unilateral authority to activate exit if level 3 is hit.

4. Financial & Scenario Stress Testing  
   • Finance will run best, base, and worst-case cash-flow models, then overlay exit costs and proceeds.  
   • The hurdle: even in worst-case plus exit costs, group ROIC must stay above WACC; else we down-scale commitment or cancel entry.

5. Contingency Logistics & Communication Plan  
   • HR, Ops, and Legal pre-draft severance packages, asset disposal checklists, customer migration notes, and regulator notifications.  
   • This ensures we can pull out inside 90 days without reputational damage.

WHY THIS COURSE OF ACTION

• It converts uncertainty into priced, time-bound options, giving us flexibility at minimal incremental cost.  
• It protects group balance sheet and brand while still allowing bold growth bets.  
• It removes emotional bias—exit becomes a pre-authorised managerial routine, not a panic move.  
• Finally, having the exit playbook agreed up front increases negotiating leverage with partners and investors because they see we are disciplined stewards of capital.

That is how we will enter new markets—eyes wide open, and with the door already propped open should we need to leave.
