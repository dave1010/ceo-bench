As CEO I will guarantee that every dollar, hour, and hire is tied to the few things that move the company’s fly-wheel.  My course of action is:

1. Institute a “Strategy-to-Resource” Operating Rhythm  
   • Within 30 days each executive team will translate the three corporate priorities into quarterly OKRs, attaching a line-item budget, head-count plan, and clear lead metrics.  
   • A standing Monthly Portfolio Review—chaired by me—will track progress, surface bottlenecks, and authorize rapid resource shifts.

2. Create a single, living Resource Dashboard  
   • Finance, HR, and PMO data will feed one dashboard that shows spend, capacity, and outcome metrics in near real-time.  
   • Any initiative off track for two consecutive checkpoints will lose or gain resources automatically according to pre-set guardrails.

3. Reallocate 15 % of OpEx to high-impact bets in the next 90 days  
   • We will exit or pause projects that do not show a path to our strategic goals; released funds and talent will be reassigned to our top three growth initiatives.  
   • This “liberated capital” target will be reported to the board and the company.

4. Link incentives directly to strategic impact  
   • Leadership bonuses and equity refreshers will be tied 70 % to the success metrics of the strategic priorities, 30 % to functional excellence.  
   • Teams that deliver on priority OKRs will receive accelerated recognition and development budgets.

5. Build an annual “Zero-Based Strategy Reset”  
   • Each year we will rebuild the budget from zero, forcing every team to justify spend in terms of strategic value rather than historical inertia.

Why this course:  
• It makes resource allocation dynamic, not static, so capital follows opportunity, not precedent.  
• It embeds visibility and accountability at every level, preventing silent misalignment.  
• By hard-wiring incentives and data into the process, it sustains focus and maximizes both productivity and impact.

That is how I will ensure our resources stay laser-aligned with what matters most to win.
