As CEO, I will institutionalize ethics and corporate responsibility by building them directly into our strategy, our governance, and our incentives—so they become a non-negotiable lens through which every major decision is made.

1. Board-level mandate  
   • Establish a standing “Ethics & Responsibility Committee” of the Board that reviews all material strategic proposals (M&A, capital allocation, product launches, geographic expansion) for alignment with our Code of Conduct and ESG goals.  
   • Require every strategic memo to include an “Ethics & Impact Analysis” section signed by the accountable ELT member.

2. Hard-wired objectives and metrics  
   • Embed specific ESG and DE&I KPIs into our three-year strategic plan and the balanced scorecard.  
   • Tie 20 % of annual executive compensation to meeting these metrics (e.g., carbon-reduction targets, supplier-labor audits, community investment benchmarks).

3. Decision-support tools  
   • Deploy a standardized Ethics & Risk Matrix that quantifies reputational risk, regulatory exposure, and stakeholder impact alongside financial returns. Any proposal scoring “high-risk” must be escalated to the CEO and Board committee.

4. Operational ownership  
   • Name a Chief Ethics & Sustainability Officer reporting to me, with dotted-line access to Audit/Risk. Their team will run quarterly reviews, scenario planning, and training for senior leaders.  
   • Require every business unit to appoint an Ethics Champion responsible for integrating corporate-responsibility goals into annual operating plans.

5. Transparent accountability  
   • Publish an integrated annual report with audited ESG data and progress against science-based targets.  
   • Hold biannual town halls and an external stakeholder forum so investors, employees, NGOs, and community leaders can challenge our direction.

Why this course of action works  
• Governance at the top ensures ethics are not an afterthought but a gateway in the approval process.  
• Tying pay to ethical/ESG outcomes changes behavior faster than policies alone.  
• Standardized tools create consistency and prevent “ethics washing.”  
• Clear ownership and regular transparency build trust with regulators, customers, and talent—mitigating risk and enhancing brand value.

Bottom line: By wiring ethics and responsibility into our governance structure, our metrics, and our incentives, we make them inseparable from strategy—protecting our license to operate and positioning us for sustainable, long-term growth.
