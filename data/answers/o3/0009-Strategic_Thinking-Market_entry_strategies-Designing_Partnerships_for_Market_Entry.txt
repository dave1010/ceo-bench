Chosen course of action

I will enter the new market through one or two anchor partnerships that (a) give us immediate customer access and regulatory cover, (b) complement the capabilities we bring, and (c) can scale with us over the first five-year horizon. To ensure we pick the right partners, I will personally chair a 60-day “Market Entry Partnership Sprint” built around a disciplined 3-stage filter:

1. FIT – Strategic & Cultural Screening (Days 1-15)
• Strategic complementarity: Does the partner close our biggest market-entry gaps (distribution, brand trust, regulatory licensing, last-mile service, etc.)?
• Cultural alignment: Decision-making speed, risk appetite, ESG stance, and data-sharing philosophy must mesh with ours.
• Reputation & governance: Zero-tolerance for corruption, sanctions exposure, or human-rights red flags.

Output: long-list trimmed to 5-7 serious candidates.

2. FEASIBILITY – Quantitative, Legal & Operational Due Diligence (Days 16-40)
• Financial strength and funding capacity, validated via audited statements and stress scenarios.
• Synergy model: bottom-up revenue lift, cost-to-serve reduction and time-to-market acceleration, valued over five years; hurdle rate ≥ 20 % IRR.
• Legal/regulatory mapping: licensing, IP protection, data residency, antitrust clearance.
• Operational capability test: joint pilots or sandbox integration (API exchange, co-manufacturing sample, etc.).

Output: score-carded shortlist of 2-3 partners, rank-ordered with quantified upside, risk and mitigation plans.

3. FUTURE VALUE – Negotiation & Governance Design (Days 41-60)
• Partnership structure: choose the lightest viable model that preserves strategic control—typically a co-marketing/reseller agreement first, with a conversion path to JV or minority equity within 18 months based on milestones.
• KPI dashboard and escalation ladder: revenue, customer-sat, compliance, NPS, EBITDA contribution; reviewed jointly monthly, board-level quarterly.
• Exit & continuity clauses: pre-agreed buy-/sell-options, IP ownership, talent non-competes.

Output: signed term sheet, implementation plan, and 100-day launch calendar.

Why this course works

• Speed with discipline: A 60-day cadence prevents analysis-paralysis yet forces rigorous diligence.
• Risk-balanced: Front-loads reputational and compliance checks so we do not “marry in haste, repent at leisure.”
• Value creation focus: Quantified synergy model ensures partnership is accretive, not just convenient.
• Scalability: Starting with flexible agreements lets us test and scale without locking into an over-engineered JV.

Roles & resources

• I chair the sprint; GM-International is day-to-day lead.
• CFO (financial diligence), Chief Compliance Officer (regulatory), and Chief People Officer (cultural fit) own respective work-streams.
• External counsel and forensic accountant engaged for red-flag reviews.

Contingency

If no partner clears the hurdle, we will delay entry by one quarter and pivot to a direct, greenfield approach rather than compromise on partner quality.

Decision statement

I will approve only those partnerships that score ≥80 % on our composite Fit/Feasibility/Future-Value scorecard and deliver a minimum 20 % IRR over five years. This disciplined, CEO-led process gives us the best shot at a fast, profitable, and reputationally sound market entry.
