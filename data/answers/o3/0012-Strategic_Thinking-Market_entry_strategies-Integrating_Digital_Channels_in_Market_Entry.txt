Decisive course of action  
I will launch our “Digital-First, Hyper-local Playbook” for the new region: a 12-month, data-driven program that uses digital channels both to learn and to sell, allowing us to enter fast, adapt in real time, and out-flank entrenched competitors.

Why this course  
1. Digital touchpoints are now the lowest-cost, fastest-feedback way to read unmet needs, test propositions, and reach customers at scale.  
2. By localizing every digital element—language, influencers, payment methods, social platforms—we meet customers on their terms, not ours.  
3. Competitors are already present offline; a superior, analytically optimized online experience is the clearest white-space to win share quickly.

Execution blueprint

Phase 1 – Intelligence & soft-launch (Months 0-3)  
• Deploy social listening, search-trend mining, and programmatic scraping to map demand pockets and competitor gaps.  
• Spin up a geofenced, local-language microsite and run A/B-tested ad traffic (USD 150 k) to validate the three most promising value propositions.  
• Form partnerships with the top two local e-commerce marketplaces to benefit from their built-in trust and logistics.

Phase 2 – Launch & accelerate (Months 4-8)  
• Scale winners via a 70/20/10 digital-media budget split: 70 % performance marketing (search, paid social, marketplace ads), 20 % brand storytelling, 10 % experimental (e.g., AR try-ons).  
• Local influencer/KOL program: 15 mid-tier creators on native platforms (e.g., LINE in Thailand, WeChat in China, Instagram in MENA) releasing co-created content weekly.  
• Offer region-preferred payment options (mobile wallets, cash-on-delivery) and localized customer-service chatbots.  
• Launch a “digital-only” product bundle priced 8 % under the nearest competitor to trigger trial while protecting core margin.

Phase 3 – Deepen moat (Months 9-12)  
• Build a first-party data lake from site, marketplace, and app behavior; feed it into look-alike models to cut acquisition CAC by 15 %.  
• Introduce a loyalty app with referral rewards; goal: 40 % of sales from repeat customers by month 12.  
• Integrate online and offline: click-and-collect in high-traffic malls, pop-up events promoted via geo-targeted push.  
• Quarterly war-room reviews to re-allocate spend in real time and front-run competitor moves.

Governance & metrics  
• Regional Digital GM with P&L mandate; weekly dashboard on CAC, conversion, repeat rate, share-of-voice.  
• Exit criteria: breakeven in month 10, 5 % market share and NPS ≥ 50 by month 12; if not on track by month 6, pivot or pull.

Bottom line  
This playbook lets us enter the market with precision, build brand equity before heavy fixed costs, and create a data advantage competitors cannot easily copy—all while tailoring every move to local customer behavior.
