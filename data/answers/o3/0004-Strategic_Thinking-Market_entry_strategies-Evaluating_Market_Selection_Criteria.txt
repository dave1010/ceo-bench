My decision:

We will green-light only those international markets that clear four non-negotiable gates—Strategic Fit, Financial Attractiveness, Execution Feasibility, and Risk/Compliance—because together they guarantee that every dollar and hour we spend pushes the company toward the growth, margin, and brand-leadership objectives set in our five-year plan.

1. Strategic Fit (Must score ≥ 8/10 on our core-competency scorecard)  
   • Does the market’s unmet need map to our unique product strengths?  
   • Will success there strengthen our global brand architecture or create dilutive distraction?  
   Rationale: Expansion is leverage, not exploration; if it doesn’t amplify what we already do best, it erodes focus and enterprise value.

2. Financial Attractiveness (IRR ≥ 18 %, break-even ≤ 24 months)  
   • Total addressable market, sustainable pricing, and gross-margin parity with home markets.  
   Rationale: Capital is finite. We must out-earn our weighted cost of capital and protect our EBIT margin trajectory.

3. Execution Feasibility (Capability “time-to-muscle” ≤ 12 months)  
   • Supply-chain reach, talent availability, and channel partnerships are in place or can be secured quickly at acceptable cost.  
   Rationale: Strategy without execution speed is opportunity lost; slow ramps dilute ROI and invite competitive retaliation.

4. Risk & Compliance (Political/regulatory score ≥ B+, downside loss < 5 % of annual EBITDA)  
   • Regulatory clarity, IP protection, currency stability, and ESG alignment.  
   Rationale: We safeguard shareholder value by refusing tail-risk exposures that can cripple the balance sheet or reputation.

Course of action:

• Immediately deploy a cross-functional team to apply this four-gate filter to our current long-list of six target countries, delivering a ranked, data-backed recommendation to the board in 60 days.  
• Markets clearing all four thresholds will proceed to full entry planning; those failing any single gate will be parked until conditions change.

Why:

This disciplined framework keeps us laser-aligned with our strategic goals—profitable growth, brand strengthening, and risk-controlled expansion—while preventing resource dilution and strategic drift.
