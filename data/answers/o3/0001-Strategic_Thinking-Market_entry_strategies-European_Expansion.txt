CEO Decision & 12-Month European Entry Plan

Strategic Decision  
We will enter Europe in a phased, tightly-scoped way, proving product/market fit in two core markets—Germany and the Netherlands—before scaling across the continent. These countries give us (1) large, high-value customers, (2) strong purchasing power, and (3) regulatory clarity that will help us build a repeatable playbook for the rest of Europe.

Why this approach works  
• Focus beats dilution: two launch countries keep spend and execution risk contained.  
• Contiguity: success in DACH/Benelux quickly translates to adjacent markets (France, Nordics).  
• Talent & logistics: Amsterdam offers an English-speaking hub with world-class distribution, while Germany supplies enterprise reference customers.

12-Month Execution Roadmap

Q1 (Months 1-3) – Foundation & Localization  
1. Appoint a VP Europe (already identified from our shortlist) and incorporate a BV in the Netherlands.  
2. Formalize data-privacy, tax, and employment frameworks—GDPR audit completed within 45 days.  
3. Localize product (language packs, payment rails, Euro pricing) and marketing collateral for DE/NL.  
4. Allocate $4 M entry budget; set OKRs: $2 M ACV signed, NPS ≥60, cash burn < plan.

Q2 (Months 4-6) – Early Market Penetration  
1. Hire first 15 FTEs: 6 enterprise AEs (3 DE, 3 NL), 3 solutions engineers, 2 CSMs, 2 marketers, 2 ops.  
2. Secure Tier-1 launch customers—targeting two German multinationals and three mid-market Dutch firms; offer 6-month pilot pricing to accelerate uptake.  
3. Stand up Amsterdam distribution hub and Frankfurt AWS region for data residency.  
4. Launch PR + demand-gen campaign at Hannover Messe and The Next Web Conference.

Q3 (Months 7-9) – Proof & Expansion Prep  
1. Achieve $1 M ARR from pilots; convert at least 70 % to multi-year contracts.  
2. Implement customer-led roadmap tweaks (e.g., SEPA Direct Debit integration).  
3. Run a win/loss analysis; use findings to finalize playbook for France & Nordics.  
4. Prepare compliance filings for France (CNIL) and Sweden (KIM). Continue talent pipeline.

Q4 (Months 10-12) – Scale & Repeatability  
1. Increase sales headcount to 25; open Paris and Stockholm satellite offices if ARR ≥ $3 M.  
2. Enter marketplace partnerships with SAP Store and Dutch reseller Bechtle.  
3. Launch self-serve onboarding in Eurozone; cut CAC by 15 %.  
4. Review KPIs:  
   • ARR ≥ $4 M, QoQ growth ≥ 30 %  
   • Churn < 5 %  
   • Gross margin ≥ 72 %  
   Green-light next-year rollouts to France, Nordics, UK (post-Brexit entity via Ireland) if ≥ 80 % of KPIs met.

Risk Management & Contingencies  
• Currency: Lock 12-month EUR hedges; pricing floor at €/$ 1.15.  
• Regulatory: Outside counsel on call; hold quarterly GDPR compliance reviews.  
• Talent: Retain flexibility—use PEO for non-core hires until Series-B expansion funds.  
• Geopolitical: Monitor energy-price shocks; warehouse 4-month safety stock in Rotterdam.

Expected Outcome  
Disciplined focus lets us establish a €4-5 M beachhead, validate the product under EU regulations, and build a cross-border operating model ready for scale—all while capping net cash outlay at <$8 M and preserving optionality for wider European dominance in year two.
