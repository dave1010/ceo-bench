I consider risk anticipation and mitigation a core responsibility of the CEO. Over the next 12 months I will institutionalize a three-layered, data-driven risk-management system that goes well beyond today’s quarterly reviews:

1. Enterprise Risk Council (ERC) – Launch next month  
   • Cross-functional leaders with authority and budget  
   • Meets monthly and reports to the board each quarter  
   • Owns a continuously updated “Top-10 Emerging Risks” dashboard

2. Predictive analytics + external signal scanning – Live within 90 days  
   • Integrate macro-economic, geopolitical, cyber-threat, and supply-chain feeds into one platform  
   • AI-driven early-warning indicators tied directly to business unit KPIs  
   • Automatic escalation protocols (red/amber/green)

3. Scenario war-gaming and balance-sheet shock testing – Twice per year starting Q4  
   • Simulate black-swan events (e.g., 30 % revenue shock, full data-center outage, critical supplier failure)  
   • Pre-approved playbooks for liquidity, workforce, and customer-communication responses

Why this course of action:

• Speed and ownership – A standing ERC gives risk a permanent seat at the decision table instead of episodic attention.  
• Data over intuition – Real-time external signals paired with internal KPIs let us see inflection points 3–6 months earlier.  
• Muscle memory – Rehearsed playbooks cut reaction time from weeks to hours when a crisis hits, protecting cash, customers, and brand.

By locking these mechanisms into our operating rhythm I am confident we will move from reactive risk management to a proactive capability that safeguards the company’s long-term stability without stifling growth.
