As CEO, I treat resources—capital, talent, and time—as the most strategic levers I control. My course of action is built on a disciplined, repeatable framework that converts strategy into an explicit portfolio of funded bets and continuously reallocates resources to the highest-impact work.

1. Translate strategy into ‘Must-Win Battles’  
   • Each year I distill the 3–5 outcomes that will most move enterprise value (e.g., penetrate segment X, launch platform Y, hit cash-flow break-even in region Z).  
   • I express every battle as a quantified OKR so success is unambiguous and trackable.

2. Establish a single enterprise resource pool  
   • All discretionary OpEx and CapEx, plus 15 % of baseline headcount, go into one pot. Business units no longer “own” money; they win it by merit.  
   • This forces trade-offs at the top rather than allowing sub-scale projects to survive in silos.

3. Rank initiatives with a fact-based portfolio lens  
   • Every initiative is scored against three weighted criteria: Strategic Fit (40 %), Value/ROI (40 %), and Risk/Time-to-Impact (20 %).  
   • I require CFO-validated NPV and scenario ranges. Purely qualitative arguments do not get funded.  
   • The result is a ranked queue that makes the cost of saying “yes” or “no” transparent.

4. Allocate using the 70 / 20 / 10 rule  
   • 70 % to core drivers that keep the economic engine healthy.  
   • 20 % to adjacencies that can scale within 24 months.  
   • 10 % to breakout bets; I cap each at <3 % of annual budget to limit downside.

5. Assign A-level talent before releasing dollars  
   • No priority project launches until it has an accountable GM-level leader and 80 % of required critical skills identified on day one.  
   • Star performers are redeployed from sunset activities; we pay stay bonuses if necessary to backfill BAU roles.

6. Use a quarterly “Capital Re-Up” meeting to reallocate fast  
   • Projects hit stage-gate KPIs or funding is reduced/terminated; freed resources roll to the next item in the ranked queue.  
   • This keeps us biased toward options that are working and prevents the sunk-cost fallacy.

7. Embed transparency and communication  
   • The full ranked list and funding decisions are published on our internal portal within 24 h of approval.  
   • Every employee can see how their work links to a Must-Win Battle, driving engagement and alignment.

Why this works  
• Focus: Limiting objectives to the vital few prevents dilution.  
• Agility: Quarterly reallocation lets us surf changes in market reality, not admire them.  
• Accountability: Data-driven stage gates and visible scorecards make ownership unmistakable.  
• Talent leverage: Putting our best people on the biggest opportunities multiplies returns.

In short, I ensure we achieve our strategic objectives by running resource allocation as an explicit, numbers-driven portfolio process—rigorously ranked, talent-anchored, and reviewed every quarter—so money and people are always concentrated on the work that maximizes enterprise value.
