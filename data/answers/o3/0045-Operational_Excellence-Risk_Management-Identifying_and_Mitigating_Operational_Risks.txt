My directive as CEO is to make “no surprises” the norm, not the aspiration. I will institutionalize the following operating model, effective immediately:

1. Embed risk ownership at the source  
   • Each business-unit head becomes the “Chief Risk Officer” for their area, accountable for a living risk register reviewed monthly.  
   • KPIs are revised to include a risk-adjusted performance metric, so leaders cannot hit numbers by silently raising the firm’s exposure.

2. Always-on risk sensing (“Radar-360”)  
   • Internal: real-time dashboards that scrape ERP, MES, CRM and HRIS data for anomalies (e.g., spike in scrap, absenteeism clusters, delayed receivables).  
   • External: AI-driven news, social, regulatory and supplier-credit feeds to flag geopolitical, compliance or supply-chain tremors.  
   • A red-amber-green early-warning index is pushed to my phone and the Board Risk Committee weekly; red events trigger a 24-hour response clock.

3. Scenario stress-testing and premortems  
   • Quarterly “black-ice drills”: cross-functional teams run Monte-Carlo stress tests on key assumptions (FX, commodity prices, cyber breach, plant outage).  
   • Premortem sessions force teams to imagine the project has failed catastrophically and list the reasons; those reasons become mitigation tasks with owners and budgets.

4. Four-tier mitigation playbook  
   1. Eliminate: redesign products/processes to remove the hazard.  
   2. Reduce: dual-source critical parts, buffer inventory of A-class SKUs, automate quality gates.  
   3. Transfer: insurance, hedging, shared-risk contracts.  
   4. Accept: when exposure < expected value inside our risk appetite; reserve capital accordingly.

5. Governance that bites  
   • A standing Risk Council (COO, CFO, CIO, CHRO, General Counsel) meets monthly; I chair it quarterly.  
   • “If it’s not in the register, it’s not approved”: capital projects and M&A proposals must show quantified residual risk and mitigation cost.  
   • Board receives heat-map and top-10 residual risks each quarter; executive compensation is claw-back eligible for undisclosed material risks.

6. Culture: speak up, get thanked—hide risk, get fired  
   • Anonymous “RiskLine” and quarterly town-halls celebrate risk-spotters.  
   • Mandatory post-mortems with blameless reporting; concealment is a terminable offense.

Why this course of action works  
• Moves from reactive audit mindset to proactive, data-driven sensing.  
• Places accountability with those closest to the process while giving the C-suite and Board real-time transparency.  
• Balances agility and control: we don’t paralyze the business but ensure every strategic bet is risk-priced.  
• Creates an organizational memory that compounds; each incident becomes codified knowledge, reducing repeat errors.

Bottom line: By hard-wiring risk intelligence into daily operations and leadership incentives, we cut the probability and impact of surprises, protect EBITDA, and preserve license to operate—turning risk management into a competitive advantage rather than a compliance chore.
