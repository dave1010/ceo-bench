Chosen Course of Action  
I institutionalize a single, integrated “Vision-2030 Playbook” that ties every three-year strategic plan and every twelve-month operating plan to one North-Star ambition: durable value creation that is environmentally sound, socially responsible, and financially superior. I do this in five concrete steps:

1. Define the Long-Term “North Star.”  
   • With the Board and key external stakeholders, we set a 10-year aspiration (e.g., double EBITDA while reaching net-zero Scope 1 & 2 emissions and a top-quartile eNPS).  
   • We translate that aspiration into five non-negotiable outcomes (growth, margin, carbon, people, and innovation).

2. Embed Sustainability and Growth Screens in Capital Allocation.  
   • Every strategic initiative must pass a “3P Gate” (Profitability, People, Planet) and a hurdle-rate that includes an internal carbon price and a discount for social-license risk.  
   • CapEx and M&A proposals are ranked with a dual NPV: financial NPV and Sustainability NPV; only projects accretive on both dimensions go forward unless the Board overrides.

3. Run an Annual Dual-Horizon Planning Cycle.  
   • Horizon 1 (0-3 yrs): detailed financial and operating plan with OKRs tied to compensation.  
   • Horizon 2/3 (3-10 yrs): scenario planning against macro, regulatory, and technology shifts; stress-tested for climate and resource constraints.  
   • Outputs are fused into a rolling three-year strategic plan that is refreshed each February.

4. Embed Metrics and Accountability.  
   • Balanced scorecard cascades from the Board down to individual managers; 25 % of variable pay is linked to ESG milestones, 75 % to growth and ROIC.  
   • Quarterly “Strategy & Sustainability Review” with real-time dashboards so mid-course corrections are data-driven.

5. Govern Through a Growth & Sustainability Council.  
   • Cross-functional body (Ops, Finance, HR, R&D, Supply Chain) chaired by me meets monthly to vet progress and break silos.  
   • We publish an Integrated Report annually so investors, regulators, customers, and employees can track commitments versus results.

Why This Works  
• Clarity: A single North-Star ambition prevents drift and short-termism.  
• Capital Discipline: Embedding ESG economics in hurdle rates ensures we do not mortgage the future for today’s earnings.  
• Agility: Rolling planning and scenario stress-tests let us pivot ahead of regulatory or market inflections.  
• Accountability: Hard-wired metrics and pay linkage keep the entire leadership team aligned and focused.

By hard-coding long-term vision and sustainable growth into every stage of planning, governance, and rewards, we ensure the company outperforms not just this quarter, but for decades.
