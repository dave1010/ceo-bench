COURSE OF ACTION  

I will launch a “Local-First, 10X-Better” market-entry program that simultaneously (1) solves the single largest pain-point local customers face and (2) showcases a signature capability none of the incumbents can match. The program will be executed in three tightly sequenced phases over 12 months.

PHASE 1 – Nail the Unmet Need (90 days)  
1. Personally lead a 30-day “Customer Zero” sprint: embed cross-functional mini-teams in the field to live a week in the shoes of target users, document the No. 1 friction point competitors leave unresolved, and quantify its economic impact.  
2. Commission rapid conjoint and pricing studies to confirm willingness to pay for a 10X improvement on that pain-point; lock the problem statement.

PHASE 2 – Build the 10X Differentiator (120 days)  
3. Redirect 70 % of local product budget to a single flagship feature that crushes the chosen pain-point (e.g., 4-hour delivery guarantee vs. market’s 48-hour norm). Strip away non-essentials so we are faster and more focused than incumbents.  
4. Protect it: file provisional IP, negotiate exclusivity on any enabling tech, and craft bold “Only-We-Can” messaging.  
5. Localize around the flagship: adapt UX language, payments, and service hours to cultural norms identified in Phase 1.

PHASE 3 – Blitz-Scale Launch (180 days)  
6. Distribution: partner with the two channels that control >60 % of category volume (already pre-engaged during Phase 1); give them co-marketing funds tied to performance.  
7. Pricing: introduce a transparent “win-win” model—premium on the flagship feature; market-parity on commodity features—to signal both superiority and fairness.  
8. Brand: unveil a single, provocative promise (“From 48 h to 4 h—Guaranteed”) backed by a compensation-for-failure clause; run hyper-targeted digital and outdoor around moments of maximum pain (e.g., rush-hour corridors).  
9. Local talent: hire a respected industry operator as Country GM, give her P&L ownership, and publicly empower her to override HQ where local conditions demand it.  
10. Metrics: track daily Net Promoter Score, adoption of flagship feature, and payback period; publish progress internally every week to sustain urgency.

WHY THIS WORKS  
• Focus beats breadth: By solving one mission-critical problem 10-times better, we escape commodity comparisons and force competitors onto our turf.  
• Local authenticity: Deep immersion and a local GM with veto power ensure we adapt where it matters (payments, language, service style) without diluting our global edge.  
• Credibility through risk reversal: The guarantee turns a marketing claim into a contract, lowering adoption barriers and signaling confidence.  
• Speed and visibility: A 12-month, milestone-driven plan lets us out-maneuver slower incumbents and makes resource needs explicit to the Board.  

I will green-light this plan immediately, allocate an initial $12 M (split 40 % product, 35 % go-to-market, 25 % contingency), and report progress at the next quarterly meeting.
