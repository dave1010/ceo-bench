Course of Action  
I will institutionalize a “Strike-Zone” framework that tells us precisely when to pull the trigger on any new-market entry. It has four gates—Demand, Right-to-Win, Cost of Delay, and Risk Cushion—and we enter only when at least three of the four gates are solid green.  

Why This Works  
1. Demand Gate – We track a leading-indicator scorecard (search trends, pilot-customer LOIs, regulatory tailwinds). The moment the TAM shows a 15 % CAGR run-rate and we have pre-orders covering the first 18 months of capacity, the gate turns green.  
2. Right-to-Win Gate – We require a minimum 2-year technology or cost advantage validated by third-party benchmarking and a defensible IP/partnership moat (e.g., exclusive supply contracts). If we do not clearly beat the top two incumbents on at least one critical buying factor, we wait or acquire.  
3. Cost-of-Delay Gate – Finance models how much NPV we lose per quarter of inaction versus the incremental capital at risk. If the lost NPV exceeds 1.5 × the capital at risk, delay is too expensive and the gate flips green.  
4. Risk-Cushion Gate – We maintain a liquidity buffer equal to 2× the projected cash burn to survive worst-case adoption lags. The gate is green only when that cushion is funded.

Execution Steps  
• Q1: Stand up a Market Sensing Cell (three analysts + one BD lead) reporting to me.  
• Q2: Produce the first Strike-Zone dashboard for our top three target markets; update monthly.  
• Q3: Run limited pilots with lighthouse customers to hard-validate Gates 1 and 2.  
• Board Approval: We only seek cap-ex release when three gates are green; otherwise we continue to learn cheaply.

Outcome  
This approach codifies discipline, prevents both premature entry (burning cash before the market is ready) and late entry (forfeiting strategic ground), and aligns every function on a single, quantifiable “go” signal. It maximizes competitive advantage by ensuring we arrive exactly when the market is big enough to scale but not yet crowded, and it protects long-term growth by gating spend behind clear, data-backed thresholds.
