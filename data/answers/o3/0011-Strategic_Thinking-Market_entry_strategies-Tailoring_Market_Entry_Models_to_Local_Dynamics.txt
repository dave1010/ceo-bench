Decision  
I will enter the market through a two-year, partnership-led, phased launch that combines a 51 %-owned joint venture with a locally licenced distribution network. This model lets us embed cultural insight, secure regulatory clearance quickly, and tune our economics to local purchasing power while retaining strategic control.

Why this course of action works  

1. Cultural Fit  
• A joint venture puts respected local executives on our board from day one, signalling commitment and giving us an “insider’s” view of consumer preferences, negotiation styles, and talent practices.  
• We will co-create the customer experience: keep our global brand promise but localise pricing bundles, UX language, and after-sales support using in-market ethnographic research completed in the first 90 days.

2. Regulatory Assurance  
• The JV will hold the operating licences; its local majority satisfies foreign-ownership caps and accelerates approvals.  
• We will embed a compliance office staffed with former regulators and a Big-Four audit partner under a zero-tolerance policy—costly up front, cheap compared with shutdown risk.  
• A Government-Relations cell, reporting to me, will maintain quarterly contact with key ministries and industry associations to shape pending rules rather than react to them.

3. Economic Resilience  
• The model is asset-light in year one: contract manufacturing and third-party logistics keep capex < 4 % of revenue until we hit breakeven.  
• A tiered product line (premium/core/value) defends margins while matching vastly different income bands identified in our macro/household-spend analysis.  
• We will hedge FX exposure by invoicing in local currency and funding 70 % of working capital through local debt—natural currency matching.

Execution Milestones  
• 0-90 days: finalise JV term sheet, complete cultural immersion sprints, file regulatory applications.  
• 90-180 days: pilot launch in two metro areas, iterate offer, secure first 500 B2B accounts.  
• 6-24 months: scale nationally, begin localisation of production, exercise call option to raise our stake to 70 % once ROIC ≥ 15 %.

This approach balances speed with prudence, leverages local strengths, and gives us a clear path to majority control and profitability in a complex, unfamiliar environment—exactly the mandate I have from our board.
