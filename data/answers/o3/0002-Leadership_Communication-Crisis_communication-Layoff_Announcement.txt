Team,

Today I need to share a difficult but necessary decision: we will reduce our workforce by roughly 10 % over the next 30 days. This step is essential to keep the company on a healthy footing and give us the flexibility to invest in the products and markets where we see the strongest, most sustainable growth.

What this means
• Affected teammates will be notified within 24 hours and will receive a minimum of 12 weeks’ pay, continued health coverage through year-end, and professional placement support.  
• No additional reductions are planned; this action rightsizes our cost structure for the next stage of growth.  
• All current strategic projects and product roadmaps remain funded—our long-term vision is unchanged.

Why we’re doing it
Demand in two of our legacy lines slowed faster than expected, while our newer cloud and data offerings are growing quickly. Rebalancing now protects our profitability, accelerates investment in the high-growth areas, and—most importantly—allows us to keep innovating for our customers without repeated cuts later.

What happens next
• Leaders will meet with every team this week to realign priorities and answer questions.  
• We are freezing senior-level hiring but continuing to recruit for revenue-generating and product-critical roles.  
• A company-wide town hall will be held Thursday at 1 p.m. to address concerns and outline our 18-month plan.

How we move forward together
Our culture is built on resilience and execution. The colleagues leaving us have contributed immeasurably; please extend your support and gratitude. For those remaining, know that this decision was made to protect the work you are doing and to position us for the opportunities ahead. We still control our destiny, and with renewed focus we will deliver the next chapter of innovation our customers expect.

Thank you for your professionalism and commitment during this transition.

[CEO Name]
