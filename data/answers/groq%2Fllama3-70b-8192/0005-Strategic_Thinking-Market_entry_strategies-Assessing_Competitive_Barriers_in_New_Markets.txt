As the CEO, I would take a thorough and structured approach to evaluating competitive barriers and regulatory challenges when considering entry into a new international market. Here's my chosen course of action:

**Initial Assessment (Weeks 1-4)**

1. **Market Research**: Conduct in-depth market research to identify the target customer segments, their needs, and preferences.
2. **Competitor Analysis**: Analyze the competitive landscape, including local and global players, their market share, strengths, and weaknesses.
3. **Regulatory Review**: Review the regulatory environment, including laws, regulations, and policies governing the industry in the target market.

**Identifying Key Barriers and Challenges (Weeks 5-8)**

1. **Competitive Barriers**: Identify the competitive barriers, such as high market saturation, strong incumbent players, or lack of distribution channels.
2. **Regulatory Challenges**: Identify the regulatory challenges, such as obtaining necessary licenses, complying with local laws and regulations, or navigating complex bureaucratic processes.

**Strategy Development (Weeks 9-12)**

1. **Partnership and Collaboration**: Identify potential local partners or collaborators who can provide insight into the market, help navigate regulatory hurdles, and strengthen our competitive position.
2. **Localization Strategy**: Develop a localization strategy to adapt our products or services to meet the unique needs and preferences of the target market.
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Develop a plan to ensure compliance with local regulations, including obtaining necessary licenses and permits, and implementing processes to ensure ongoing compliance.
4. **Competitive Differentiation**: Identify opportunities to differentiate our products or services from those of local competitors, such as through innovation, quality, or customer service.

**Implementation and Monitoring (After Week 12)**

1. **Phased Market Entry**: Enter the market in phases, starting with a small pilot or test market to refine our strategy and mitigate risks.
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the market, competitors, and regulatory environment to identify opportunities and challenges, and adjust our strategy accordingly.

**Why This Approach?**

This approach allows us to thoroughly evaluate the competitive barriers and regulatory challenges, and develop a tailored strategy to overcome them. By partnering with local entities, adapting to local market needs, and ensuring regulatory compliance, we can mitigate risks and increase our chances of success in the new international market. Additionally, our phased market entry approach and continuous monitoring will enable us to be agile and responsive to changing market conditions.
