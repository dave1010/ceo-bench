As the CEO, I ensure that performance metrics are tightly aligned with our company's strategic goals by implementing a rigorous goal-setting process that cascades down to every level of the organization.

Here's my chosen course of action:

**Step 1: Clearly Define Strategic Objectives**
I work closely with my executive team to establish a set of clear, measurable, and achievable strategic objectives that align with our company's mission and vision. These objectives are communicated company-wide to ensure everyone understands how their work contributes to our overall success.

**Step 2: Establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
We develop KPIs that directly tie to each strategic objective. These metrics are carefully selected to provide a balanced view of our performance, including financial, customer, operational, and innovation metrics. For example, if one of our strategic objectives is to increase customer satisfaction, our KPI might be to achieve a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 80 within the next 12 months.

**Step 3: Cascade Goals and KPIs**
Each department and team lead develops their own set of goals and KPIs that directly support the company's strategic objectives. This ensures that everyone's efforts are focused on achieving our overall company goals.

**Step 4: Regular Review and Adjustment**
We hold regular review sessions to assess our progress toward our strategic objectives. If we're not meeting our targets, we adjust our tactics and allocate resources accordingly. We also use this process to identify areas for improvement and opportunities to innovate.

**Why this approach?**
This approach ensures that everyone in the organization is working towards the same goals, which drives overall success. By aligning performance metrics with strategic objectives, we:

* Focus our efforts on what matters most
* Measure progress and make data-driven decisions
* Encourage innovation and experimentation to achieve our goals
* Recognize and reward teams and individuals who make significant contributions to our success

By following this process, I'm confident that we'll drive overall success and achieve our strategic objectives.
