As CEO, I will prioritize addressing customer complaints that directly impact customer retention and the company's reputationâ€”specifically, those involving safety, core product functionality, or service disruptions that affect a large segment of our customer base. By resolving issues with the highest potential to cause customer churn or damage our brand trust first, we demonstrate our commitment to quality and customer satisfaction. Simultaneously, I will communicate transparently with all customers, acknowledging their concerns and providing clear timelines for resolution. This targeted approach ensures efficient resource allocation, preserves our brand integrity, and fosters customer loyalty even amid constraints.
