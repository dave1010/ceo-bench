As CEO, I will prioritize a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis that quantifies the potential financial and reputational damages of a successful cyber attack against the investment required for mitigation. Given the high stakes—significant data breaches can lead to substantial loss of customer trust, legal liabilities, and long-term brand damage—I will opt to implement robust cybersecurity measures despite the upfront costs. Protecting our company's integrity, customer confidence, and long-term viability takes precedence over short-term profitability. This strategic choice ensures we proactively manage critical risks and position the company as a responsible, secure leader in our industry.
