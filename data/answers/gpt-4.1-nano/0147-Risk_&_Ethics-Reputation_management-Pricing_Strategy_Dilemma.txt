I choose to maintain our current pricing strategy. While the competitor’s price cut may generate short-term customer interest, our differentiated value proposition—based on quality, innovation, and brand reputation—positions us for sustainable growth. We will instead invest in targeted marketing, enhanced customer engagement, and value-added services to reinforce our market leadership. This approach protects our margins and long-term profitability, ensuring we don’t compromise our brand integrity while remaining competitive through superior value.
