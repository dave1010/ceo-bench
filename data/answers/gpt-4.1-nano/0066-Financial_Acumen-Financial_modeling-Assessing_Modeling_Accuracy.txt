The CEO typically evaluates the accuracy and reliability of financial models before making strategic decisions through a comprehensive process that includes the following steps:

1. **Data Validation**: Ensuring that all input data is accurate, complete, and current. This involves cross-checking data sources, verifying data integrity, and updating datasets as needed.

2. **Model Testing and Sensitivity Analysis**: Running the models under various scenarios to assess how changes in key assumptions impact outcomes. Sensitivity analysis helps identify which variables have the most influence on results and ensures the model’s robustness.

3. **Benchmarking and Historical Comparison**: Comparing model outputs with historical actuals and industry benchmarks to ensure consistency and reasonableness.

4. **Expert Review and Audit**: Engaging financial analysts, industry experts, or internal auditors to review the model’s structure, formulas, and assumptions for any errors or biases.

5. **Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis**: Simulating extreme but plausible scenarios to see how the model performs under different conditions, thereby testing its reliability and resilience.

6. **Regular Updates and Refinement**: Continuously updating models with new data and refining assumptions based on latest market trends, ensuring ongoing accuracy.

7. **Documentation and Transparency**: Maintaining thorough documentation of the model’s methodology, assumptions, and data sources to facilitate understanding, review, and validation.

By systematically applying these practices, the CEO ensures that financial models provide a dependable foundation for making sound strategic decisions.
