The CEO prioritizes capital allocation among competing projects by systematically evaluating each project's potential to generate value, aligning decisions with the company's strategic objectives, and considering risk and resource constraints. This process typically involves:

1. **Assessing Financial Returns:** Analyzing metrics such as projected cash flows, internal rate of return (IRR), net present value (NPV), and payback period to determine which projects offer the highest potential for creating shareholder value.

2. **Strategic Alignment:** Ensuring projects support the company's long-term goals, core competencies, and market positioning, thereby contributing to sustained growth.

3. **Risk Management:** Evaluating the risks associated with each project, including market, operational, and financial risks, and prioritizing those with manageable risk profiles and favorable risk-adjusted returns.

4. **Resource Constraints:** Considering available capital, human resources, and operational capacity to ensure projects are feasible and sustainable.

5. **Portfolio Diversification:** Balancing investments across different projects and sectors to mitigate risk and optimize the overall return of the company's investment portfolio.

6. **Stakeholder Value Consideration:** Weighing the potential impact on stakeholders, including customers, employees, and shareholders, to ensure investments support long-term value creation.

By integrating these considerations into a disciplined decision-making framework, the CEO aims to allocate capital efficiently, maximizing shareholder value while maintaining strategic flexibility and risk mitigation.
