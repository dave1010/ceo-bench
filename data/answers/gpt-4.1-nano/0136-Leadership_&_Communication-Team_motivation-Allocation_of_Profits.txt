As CEO, I will prioritize reinvesting a significant portion of profits into strategic growth initiatives that enhance our core competencies, expand market share, and foster innovation. This approach ensures sustainable long-term value creation. Simultaneously, I will allocate a reasonable dividend payout to maintain shareholder confidence and demonstrate our commitment to delivering returns. Additionally, I will strengthen our financial position by maintaining healthy liquidity and prudently managing debt to buffer against market uncertainties. By balancing these priorities—investing for growth, rewarding shareholders, and maintaining financial health—I ensure the company's long-term sustainability and maximize overall shareholder value.
