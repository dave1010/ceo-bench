I would prioritize entering the high-growth, competitive market early. Establishing a presence there allows us to capitalize on rapid growth opportunities, build brand recognition quickly, and develop valuable market insights that can be leveraged for future expansions. While competition is tougher, our resources and strategic positioning will enable us to gain a foothold, generate momentum, and create barriers for competitors. This approach maximizes our potential for revenue and market influence in the short term, setting a strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth as we later expand into less competitive markets with more established positioning.
