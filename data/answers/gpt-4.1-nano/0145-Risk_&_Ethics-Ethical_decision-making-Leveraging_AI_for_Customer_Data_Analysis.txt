As CEO, I prioritize ethical integrity and customer trust above all. Therefore, I will implement AI-driven targeted marketing only after establishing strict data privacy protocols that adhere to legal standards and industry best practices. This includes obtaining explicit customer consent, transparently communicating how their data will be used, and providing easy opt-out options. I will also establish an internal oversight committee to monitor data usage for ethical compliance. By balancing innovative marketing tactics with a strong commitment to privacy, we can responsibly leverage AI to increase sales while upholding our company's reputation and ethical principles.
