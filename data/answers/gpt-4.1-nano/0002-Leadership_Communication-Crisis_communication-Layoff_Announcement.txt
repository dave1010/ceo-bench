Dear Team,

After careful assessment of our current position and future goals, we have made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 10%. This step is necessary to ensure our continued strength and ability to innovate in a competitive landscape. We are committed to supporting those affected through this transition with personalized assistance and resources. While change is challenging, I want to emphasize our appreciation for everyone's dedication and resilience. Together, we will navigate this period and emerge stronger as a team.

Thank you for your understanding and ongoing commitment.

Best regards,  
[CEO Name]
