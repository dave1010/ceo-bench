I will proceed with the cloud migration, provided that a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis demonstrates a clear long-term return on investment. The decision is rooted in the strategic imperative to enhance operational efficiency, reduce ongoing maintenance costs, and position the company competitively in a digital-first landscape.

To mitigate risks, I will ensure thorough planning, stakeholder engagement, and phased implementation, allowing us to realize value quickly while managing short-term impacts effectively.
