As CEO, I believe the appropriate time to make a decisive pivot in strategy is when the current approach clearly limits our growth potential, evidenced by stagnating or declining key metrics despite ongoing efforts. We assess the urgency through comprehensive data analysis, market signals, and competitive positioning. If the evidence indicates that maintaining the status quo will lead to missed opportunities or irrelevance, and if the potential benefits of the new direction outweigh the risks—supported by a well-structured risk mitigation plan—we must act decisively. This approach balances the need for agility with strategic prudence, ensuring that we capitalize on opportunities while managing uncertainties effectively.
