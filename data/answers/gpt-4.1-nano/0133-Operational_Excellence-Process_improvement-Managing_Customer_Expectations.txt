As CEO, I prioritize maintaining customer trust and long-term brand reputation. Therefore, I will take immediate steps to communicate transparently with affected customers, offering apologies and updates on expected delivery times. Concurrently, I will allocate resources to expedite the resolution of supply chain issues, even if it incurs short-term costs, to restore reliable delivery performance. Prioritizing transparency and swift action aligns with our commitment to exceptional customer experience, ensuring customer loyalty while addressing the root causes to prevent future delays.
