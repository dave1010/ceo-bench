Entering a new international market presents several primary risks, which should be carefully evaluated and prioritized for mitigation:

1. **Market Risk**: Uncertainty about demand, customer preferences, and cultural differences can impact sales. Conduct thorough market research and localized consumer insights to ensure product-market fit.

2. **Legal and Regulatory Risks**: Different legal systems, compliance requirements, tariffs, and trade restrictions can pose challenges. Engage local legal expertise early to understand and navigate regulations.

3. **Political and Economic Risks**: Instability, political unrest, or unfavorable government policies can threaten operations. Assess the political landscape and establish contingency plans.

4. **Currency and Financial Risks**: Fluctuations in exchange rates and difficulties in repatriating profits can affect profitability. Use hedging strategies and establish clear financial controls.

5. **Operational Risks**: Challenges in supply chain logistics, talent acquisition, and local infrastructure can impede execution. Develop strong local partnerships and adapt operational plans accordingly.

**Prioritization of Mitigation**:

1. **Legal and Regulatory Compliance**: Ensuring adherence to local laws minimizes legal penalties and operational disruptions—this should be a top priority.

2. **Market Viability**: Validating customer demand reduces the risk of product failure—invest significant effort here.

3. **Political and Economic Stability**: Securing a stable environment protects long-term investment—monitor ongoing risks and develop contingency plans.

4. **Financial Risks**: Protecting against currency fluctuations and ensuring efficient financial management safeguard profitability.

5. **Operational Readiness**: Building reliable supply chains and local teams supports sustainable growth.

In summary, a strategic approach involves first understanding and compliance with legal frameworks, validating market demand, assessing political stability, managing financial exposure, and establishing solid operational capabilities. Balancing these priorities enables a structured and risk-aware market entry.
