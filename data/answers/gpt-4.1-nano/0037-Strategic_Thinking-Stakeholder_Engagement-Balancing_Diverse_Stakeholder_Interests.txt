The CEO aligns the interests of various stakeholders—such as employees, customers, shareholders, partners, and the community—by fostering clear communication, establishing shared goals, and implementing incentive structures that promote long-term value creation. This often involves developing a compelling vision and strategy that resonates across stakeholder groups, ensuring transparency in decision-making, and balancing short-term performance with sustainable growth. Additionally, the CEO may prioritize ethical practices and corporate social responsibility initiatives to build trust and reinforce commitment from all stakeholders, ultimately supporting the company’s long-term strategic objectives.
