To proactively identify potential operational risks, I implement a combination of structured approaches such as regular risk assessments, scenario planning, and monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs). I foster a culture of transparency and encourage open communication across all levels of the organization to surface emerging risks early. Additionally, I utilize data analytics and industry trend analysis to anticipate potential disruptions. 

Once risks are identified, I develop comprehensive mitigation strategies by prioritizing risks based on their likelihood and potential impact. This includes implementing controls, diversifying supply chains, establishing contingency plans, and investing in employee training. Regular review and testing of these strategies ensure they remain effective and adaptable to changing circumstances. By integrating risk management into our strategic planning process, I aim to minimize disruptions and sustain operational resilience.
