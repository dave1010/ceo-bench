Ensuring continued compliance amid rapidly evolving regulations across multiple jurisdictions requires a proactive and strategic approach. I would implement the following measures:

1. **Establish a Robust Regulatory Monitoring System:**  
   Create or leverage advanced tools and services to track legal and regulatory developments in all jurisdictions where the company operates. This includes subscribing to industry alerts, participating in industry associations, and engaging legal counsel specialized in local laws.

2. **Build a Cross-Functional Compliance Team:**  
   Assemble a dedicated team comprising legal, compliance, risk management, and business unit experts. This team is responsible for interpreting new regulations, assessing their impact, and advising the organization on necessary adjustments.

3. **Develop a Dynamic Compliance Framework:**  
   Implement flexible policies and procedures that can be quickly adapted in response to regulatory changes. Regularly review and update internal controls to ensure they remain aligned with the latest requirements.

4. **Invest in Training and Education:**  
   Provide ongoing training programs for employees worldwide to raise awareness about compliance requirements and foster a culture of legal and ethical responsibility.

5. **Leverage Technology and Automation:**  
   Use compliance management software, AI-driven tools, and data analytics to streamline monitoring, documentation, and reporting processes, enabling faster responses to regulatory updates.

6. **Maintain Strong Regulatory Relationships:**  
   Engage proactively with regulators and industry bodies to stay informed, seek guidance, and contribute to shaping fair and practical regulatory environments.

7. **Implement Continuous Audit and Risk Assessment:**  
   Conduct regular audits and risk assessments to identify potential compliance gaps early and implement corrective actions promptly.

By integrating these strategies, I would ensure that the company remains agile, informed, and compliant with evolving regulations across all jurisdictions, thereby safeguarding its integrity and long-term success.
