As CEO, I will prioritize full compliance with the new environmental regulations to safeguard the company's reputation, mitigate legal risks, and ensure long-term sustainability. To achieve this, I will allocate necessary resources for compliance while simultaneously identifying efficiencies and cost-saving measures elsewhere in the organization. This approach ensures we meet regulatory requirements without compromising our core operations or financial health. Failing to comply poses greater risks, including penalties and reputational damage, which could ultimately jeopardize the company's future. Therefore, proactive investment in compliance, coupled with strategic operational adjustments, offers the most balanced and sustainable path forward.
