I will prioritize defending our current market position before pursuing new market expansion. Our established markets are the foundation of our revenue and brand strength; by solidifying our presence there, we ensure stability and customer loyalty. This focus allows us to deploy our limited resources strategicallyâ€”enhancing customer relations, improving product offerings, and reinforcing our value proposition. Once we have confidently secured our existing markets, we can then allocate resources toward strategic entry into new markets. This approach maintains clarity in our objectives, ensures sustainable growth, and positions us to respond effectively to competitive pressures with a clear, decisive strategy.
