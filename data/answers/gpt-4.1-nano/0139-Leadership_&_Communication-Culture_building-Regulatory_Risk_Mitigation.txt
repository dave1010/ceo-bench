Simultaneously, I will foster an organizational culture that emphasizes ethical innovation, encourages responsible experimentation, and integrates compliance as a foundation for growth. By engaging regulators early, we can shape policies that enable innovation without compromising integrity, ensuring sustainable growth and maintaining our competitive edge in the market.
