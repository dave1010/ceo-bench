I would prioritize maintaining our company's integrity and ethical standards. Therefore, I would decline partnering with the local entity known for questionable practices, even if the financial gains are substantial. Instead, I will explore alternative market entry strategies—such as establishing a direct presence or identifying reputable local partners—that align with our values and sustainability principles. This approach ensures long-term growth built on trust and ethical conduct, safeguarding our reputation and stakeholder confidence.
