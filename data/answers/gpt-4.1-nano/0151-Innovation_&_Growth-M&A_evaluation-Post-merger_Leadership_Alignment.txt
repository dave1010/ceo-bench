As CEO, I will prioritize maximizing the long-term success of the combined entity by establishing a unified leadership structure. While preserving company cultures is important, I believe that clear, cohesive leadership is essential for strategic alignment, operational efficiency, and overall agility in executing our vision. Therefore, I will implement a centralized leadership team with dedicated cultural ambassadors to preserve core values and facilitate integration. This approach ensures consistent decision-making, operational synergies, and a strong, unified brand identity, positioning us for sustainable growth and competitiveness.
