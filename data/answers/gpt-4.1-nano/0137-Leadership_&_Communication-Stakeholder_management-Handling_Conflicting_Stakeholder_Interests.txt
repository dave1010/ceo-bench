As CEO, I will prioritize maintaining the integrity and reputation of our company. Accepting a kickback compromises our ethical standards and risks long-term trust with stakeholders, which outweighs the short-term financial gain. Therefore, I will decline the supplierâ€™s offer and seek an alternative, transparent, and mutually beneficial partnership that aligns with our values and ensures sustainable growth. Upholding ethical principles safeguards our company's brand and shareholder trust, which are critical to our ongoing success.
