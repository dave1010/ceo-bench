I will accelerate our timeline and launch before our competitor to secure a first-mover advantage. The rationale is that establishing our presence early will allow us to capture market share, set industry standards, and build brand loyalty before the competition becomes entrenched. While this approach introduces risks—such as less thorough preparation—we believe that the potential rewards of being the pioneer outweigh these concerns. To mitigate risks, we will allocate additional resources for rapid market entry, ensure crucial operations and messaging are optimized, and remain agile to adapt quickly post-launch. This decisive action aligns with our strategic objective to lead and shape emerging markets, establishing our position ahead of competitors.
