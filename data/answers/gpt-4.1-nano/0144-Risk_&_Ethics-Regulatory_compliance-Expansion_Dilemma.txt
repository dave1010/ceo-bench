As CEO, I choose to pursue the expansion into the new high-growth market. Although the upfront investment will impact short-term profitability, I believe that establishing a presence early is crucial to capturing market share, driving long-term growth, and maximizing future shareholder value. Our strategic priority is sustained growth and competitiveness, and the potential upside from entering this market outweighs the short-term financial impact. We will ensure diligent financial planning and risk management to support this decision, positioning our company for leadership in the emerging market over the coming years.
