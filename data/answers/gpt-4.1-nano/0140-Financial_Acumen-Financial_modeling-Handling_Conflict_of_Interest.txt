As CEO, I would prioritize transparency and integrity by disclosing the personal relationship to the board and relevant stakeholders. I would delegate the decision-making process for the contract to an impartial committee or senior leadership team, ensuring no undue influence from my side. This approach maintains fairness, upholds ethical standards, and preserves the company's reputation. Ultimately, I choose to prevent any appearance of bias, ensuring that the contract is awarded based solely on merit and alignment with company criteria.
