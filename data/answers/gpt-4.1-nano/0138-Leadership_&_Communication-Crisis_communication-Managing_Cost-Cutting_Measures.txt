As CEO, I recognize that safeguarding the company's long-term viability is paramount, but so is maintaining the trust and morale of our team. Therefore, I will pursue a balanced approach: first, implement strategic cost reductions focused on non-essential expenses and productivity enhancements, while actively exploring revenue-generating opportunities. Concurrently, I will prioritize transparent communication with employees, explaining the situation clearly and involving them in identifying sustainable solutions. If layoffs become unavoidable, I will ensure they are conducted with fairness, compassion, and support initiatives such as severance packages and outplacement services. This approach demonstrates responsible leadership, protects our financial health, and respects our teamâ€™s dignity, fostering resilience and a shared commitment to our recovery.
