As CEO, I will prioritize implementing the new data protection policy by allocating resources strategically to ensure compliance without compromising financial stability. I will:

1. Conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis to identify the most critical infrastructure upgrades and training needs that directly impact compliance.
2. Seek to leverage existing technology and optimize current processes before committing to extensive new investments.
3. Explore phased implementation to spread costs over time, ensuring the organization can absorb the expense without financial strain.
4. Pursue targeted external funding or partnerships where possible to offset costs.
5. Communicate transparently with stakeholders about the importance of compliance for long-term sustainability, garnering support and understanding.

This approach balances urgent regulatory requirements with prudent financial management, positioning the company for secure growth and compliance.
