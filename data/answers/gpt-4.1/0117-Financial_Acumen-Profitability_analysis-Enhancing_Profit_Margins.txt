**To analyze and improve the company's profitability across various business units, the CEO employs several key strategies:**

1. **Rigorous Financial Analysis:**  
   The CEO systematically reviews financial statements, unit-level profit & loss (P&L) statements, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess revenue streams, cost drivers, and profit margins for each business unit. This includes variance analysis to identify deviations from budgeted targets.

2. **Benchmarking and Performance Comparison:**  
   The CEO compares the performance of each business unit against industry benchmarks and internal best-performing units. This helps to highlight underperforming units and pinpoint opportunities for improvement.

3. **Cost Optimization Initiatives:**  
   By conducting detailed cost structure reviews, the CEO identifies opportunities to reduce inefficiencies, eliminate waste, and leverage shared services or economies of scale across units.

4. **Resource Allocation and Capital Deployment:**  
   The CEO assesses the return on invested capital (ROIC) for each unit and prioritizes investments in units with higher growth and profitability potential, while considering divestments or restructuring for persistently underperforming units.

5. **Strategic Pricing and Product Mix Reviews:**  
   Regular evaluation of pricing strategies, discount policies, and product or service mix helps ensure that each unit is maximizing profitability. The CEO may champion the introduction of premium offerings or discontinuation of low-margin products.

6. **Operational Excellence Initiatives:**  
   Lean management, Six Sigma, and continuous improvement programs are implemented to drive operational efficiency and cost competitiveness across units.

7. **Customer and Market Segmentation Analysis:**  
   The CEO encourages looking at profitability through the lens of customer segments and markets served, ensuring focus is on the most profitable niches and geographies.

8. **Data-Driven Decision Making:**  
   By fostering a culture that leverages analytics, the CEO enables more accurate and timely decisions regarding pricing, cost reduction, and resource allocation.

9. **Leadership and Accountability:**  
   The CEO holds business unit leaders accountable for financial performance, often tying incentives and compensation to both revenue growth and profitability improvements.

10. **Frequent Review Cadence:**  
    Finally, the CEO institutes regular business reviews (monthly or quarterly) to monitor progress, make course corrections, and ensure alignment between corporate strategy and unit-level execution.

**In summary:**  
The CEO uses a combination of financial discipline, strategic resource allocation, operational improvements, and leadership accountability to analyze and enhance profitability across all business units, ensuring sustainable growth and value creation for the company.
