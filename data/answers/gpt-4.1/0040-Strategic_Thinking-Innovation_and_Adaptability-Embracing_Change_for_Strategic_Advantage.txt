Certainly! Here’s how a CEO can foster a culture of innovation and adapt strategies in response to changing external conditions:

**1. Setting a Clear Vision and Purpose**
The CEO articulates a compelling vision that emphasizes innovation and agility as core organizational values. This vision aligns teams around the need to proactively seek new solutions and remain responsive to market shifts.

**2. Encouraging Experimentation and Risk-Taking**
The CEO fosters an environment where employees feel empowered to propose ideas, experiment, and learn from failures without fear of undue penalty. This includes allocating resources (time, budget, support) for pilot projects or innovation labs.

**3. Building Cross-Functional Collaboration**
By breaking down silos and incentivizing collaboration across departments, the CEO enables diverse perspectives to converge — often yielding more creative solutions and faster adaptation when external conditions change.

**4. Monitoring External Trends and Market Signals**
The CEO stays attuned to technological advances, competitive movements, regulatory changes, and evolving customer needs. This can involve establishing formal processes for environmental scanning, competitor benchmarking, and seeking outside perspectives via advisors or partnerships.

**5. Rapid Decision-Making and Iterative Strategy**
The CEO leads by adopting agile management techniques, enabling the company to pivot quickly when required. This includes regularly reviewing performance data, being willing to reallocate resources, and updating the strategic plan as new information becomes available.

**6. Talent Development and Diversity**
The CEO prioritizes attracting and retaining talent with diverse backgrounds and skill sets, and invests in ongoing learning and development. A diverse and continuously learning workforce is better positioned to generate innovative ideas and adapt to change.

**7. Leading by Example**
Finally, the CEO models adaptability and openness to new ideas, visibly supporting innovation initiatives and celebrating both successes and learnings from failures.

**Summary:**  
By embedding these practices, a CEO creates a culture where innovation thrives and the organization is agile and resilient in the face of changing external conditions.
