To coordinate and motivate cross-disciplinary teams for aligned execution of market entry plans, a CEO should:

**1. Set a Clear Vision and Strategy:**  
Communicate a compelling vision for the market entry and articulate clear, company-wide strategic objectives. Ensure all teams understand the 'why' behind the initiative and how their work impacts success.

**2. Foster Cross-Functional Alignment:**  
Establish cross-disciplinary working groups or project teams that include representatives from key functions (e.g., product, marketing, sales, finance, operations). Define roles and responsibilities to minimize overlaps or gaps.

**3. Encourage Open Communication:**  
Enable transparent communication channels (regular cross-team meetings, collaborative platforms, status updates) to share insights, flag issues early, and ensure all functions are moving in tandem.

**4. Set Shared Metrics and Accountability:**  
Align teams around common KPIs tied to the market entry plan (e.g., launch timelines, revenue targets, customer adoption rates). Use dashboards and OKRs to track progress and pinpoint bottlenecks.

**5. Empower and Support Teams:**  
Give teams decision-making autonomy within their domains while ensuring coordination across boundaries. Provide resources, remove obstacles, and recognize contributions.

**6. Lead by Example and Build Culture:**  
Demonstrate cross-disciplinary collaboration in your own actions. Celebrate collaborative wins, and reinforce a culture where diverse perspectives are valued in solving complex go-to-market challenges.

**7. Continuous Feedback and Adaptation:**  
Facilitate regular reviews, learn from early results, and pivot tactics as needed. Use feedback loops to enable rapid learning and adjustment, keeping all teams agile and aligned.

**Summary:**  
The CEO’s role is to set direction, enable cooperation, align incentives and metrics, and foster a collaborative culture—ensuring unified, disciplined execution of market entry plans across all teams.
