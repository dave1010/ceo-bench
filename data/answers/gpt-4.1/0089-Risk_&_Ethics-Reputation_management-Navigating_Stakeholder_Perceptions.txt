A CEO proactively shapes and communicates the company’s values during times of uncertainty by taking these key steps:

1. **Clarifying Core Values:** The CEO ensures that the company’s values are clearly defined, relevant, and reemphasized. This may involve revisiting and, if necessary, recalibrating values to make sure they address current challenges.

2. **Visible Leadership:** The CEO leads by example, embodying the company’s values in their own behavior. They make values-based decisions, especially on difficult issues, and are transparent about their reasoning.

3. **Frequent, Transparent Communication:** The CEO regularly communicates with employees, customers, and stakeholders, explicitly linking decisions and company direction back to its core values. This might include town halls, written statements, or video messages.

4. **Two-Way Engagement:** The CEO listens actively to concerns from employees and stakeholders, fostering open dialogue. They encourage feedback and proactively address doubts or rumors.

5. **Integrating Values into Decision-Making:** The CEO uses company values as a “North Star” when making tough decisions, from employee well-being to customer commitments. They share stories and specific examples where values guided actions.

6. **Empowering Leaders:** The CEO ensures that leaders at all levels are aligned and equipped to communicate and model the values, so messaging is consistent throughout the organization.

7. **Public Advocacy:** When appropriate, the CEO represents the company's values publicly—through media interviews, social media, and industry forums—to reinforce reputation and credibility.

By authentically integrating these behaviors, the CEO maintains trust, upholds the company's reputation, and positions the organization as principled and resilient in the face of uncertainty.
