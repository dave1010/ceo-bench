Certainly! Here’s a well-rounded response to the question:

An effective CEO leads due diligence during the M&A process by setting a clear mandate for thorough, cross-functional analysis that goes beyond financial statements to uncover both value drivers and potential risks. The best CEOs ensure that due diligence is not a siloed activity but a coordinated effort involving finance, legal, HR, IT, operations, and culture specialists. They champion the identification of synergies—such as cross-selling opportunities, operational efficiencies, or intellectual property—and empower teams to validate these assumptions rigorously.

The CEO also fosters a culture of transparency and open communication, encouraging teams to surface red flags—ranging from customer concentration and technology debt to regulatory and cultural risks. By emphasizing the importance of risk assessment alongside value identification, the CEO helps the organization avoid costly missteps and maximize post-merger integration success.

Ultimately, the most effective CEOs remain hands-on at critical junctures, set clear expectations for the diligence process, and use findings from due diligence to inform negotiations and integration plans. This strategic leadership ensures that M&A transactions are grounded in fact-based assessments, balancing optimism about opportunities with pragmatism about challenges.

**Assessment criteria might include:**  
- The CEO’s direct involvement and oversight in the due diligence process  
- Ability to identify and validate key value drivers and core risks  
- Coordination across functions/departments  
- Willingness to challenge assumptions and address uncomfortable truths  
- Translating due diligence findings into actionable integration and negotiation strategies
