To proactively establish and maintain trust with stakeholders during a crisis, a CEO should:

1. **Communicate Transparently and Frequently:** Quickly inform stakeholders about the situation, what is known, what is uncertain, and the steps being taken. Honesty—even when the news is unfavorable—demonstrates integrity.

2. **Show Empathy and Accountability:** Recognize concerns, acknowledge mistakes if applicable, and express commitment to stakeholder well-being. Demonstrate real concern for those affected and take ownership of the organization's actions.

3. **Provide Clear Action Plans:** Outline specific actions and timelines for addressing the crisis. Sharing the path forward conveys competence and instills confidence in the CEO’s leadership.

4. **Engage Stakeholders Directly:** Create opportunities for two-way communication (e.g., Q&A sessions, hotlines, updates). This shows stakeholders their voices are valued and can alleviate uncertainty.

5. **Align Actions with Core Values:** Make decisions and communicate in a manner consistent with the organization’s values and previously established culture, reinforcing reliability.

6. **Follow Through and Update Regularly:** Keep promises, track progress, and provide updates even if there is no major change. Consistent follow-up demonstrates commitment and reliability.

By combining transparency, empathy, clear planning, open engagement, values alignment, and accountability, a CEO can proactively build and maintain stakeholder trust even amid uncertainty and challenge.
