Subject: Important Company Update

Dear Team,

Today, I want to share some difficult news. After carefully considering our current business realities and future goals, we have made the decision to reduce our workforce by approximately 10%. This was not an easy choice, and it in no way reflects the dedication or contributions of our valued colleagues.

Our priority is to support each affected team member with respect and compassion, providing transition assistance, severance, and counseling services. For those remaining, I want to reassure you: we are taking these steps to ensure the long-term strength and stability of our company. Together, we will focus our efforts, streamline processes, and continue building a future we can all be proud of.

Thank you for your commitment, resilience, and understanding during this challenging time. We will navigate this period together, as one team.

Sincerely,  
[CEO Name]
