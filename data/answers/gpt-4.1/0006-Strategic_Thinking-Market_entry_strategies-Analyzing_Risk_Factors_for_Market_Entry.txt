Entering a new international market introduces several significant risks that can jeopardize a company's success. The primary risks include:

**1. Market Risk**  
- **Consumer behavior uncertainty:** Misunderstanding local preferences, cultural differences, or demand can lead to poor product-market fit.
- **Competitive landscape:** Local competitors may be more agile and have stronger brand recognition.

**2. Regulatory and Legal Risk**  
- **Compliance:** Different and sometimes evolving laws around product standards, employment, taxes, data protection, and reporting.
- **Political instability:** Policy changes, expropriation, or operational disruptions due to geopolitical issues.

**3. Financial and Currency Risk**  
- **Exchange rate fluctuations:** Can erode profits due to volatility.
- **Repatriation of funds:** Local restrictions on moving profits back to the home country.

**4. Operational and Supply Chain Risk**  
- **Logistics:** New supply chain partners, infrastructure quality, and transport reliability.
- **Talent:** Difficulty in recruiting, training, or retaining local talent and management.

**5. Reputational and Brand Risk**  
- **Cultural missteps:** Marketing or product mistakes that offend or alienate the local population.
- **Quality or consistency concerns:** Struggling to meet local expectations or service levels.

**Prioritization and Mitigation Approach**

**1. Regulatory and Legal Risk (Top Priority)**
   - Rationale: Non-compliance can halt operations, lead to fines, or cause reputational harm.
   - **Mitigation:** Engage local legal advisors early, conduct thorough regulatory due diligence, and design compliance frameworks tailored to the local context.

**2. Market Risk**
   - Rationale: Understanding customers is central to commercial viability.
   - **Mitigation:** Conduct robust market research, run pilot launches/minimum viable products, and hire local marketing experts.

**3. Operational and Supply Chain Risk**
   - Rationale: Poor execution can undermine strategy, regardless of demand.
   - **Mitigation:** Establish reliable local supply chain partners, and develop contingency plans for logistics disruptions.

**4. Financial and Currency Risk**
   - Rationale: Profitability depends on currency stability and the ability to extract proceeds.
   - **Mitigation:** Use hedging strategies, keep some expenses and revenues in local currency, and structure business models to allow flexibility.

**5. Reputational and Brand Risk**
   - Rationale: Early reputation can make or break entry efforts.
   - **Mitigation:** Localize branding and communications, partner with local agencies or influencers, and sensitize teams to cultural nuances.
