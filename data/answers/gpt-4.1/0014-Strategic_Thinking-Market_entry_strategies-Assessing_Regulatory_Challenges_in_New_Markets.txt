When entering a new market, a CEO plays a pivotal role in identifying and managing regulatory hurdles to ensure smooth entry and continuous compliance. The best approach is multifaceted:

**1. Early Regulatory Assessment:**  
The CEO initiates a thorough assessment of the target market’s regulatory landscape, including industry-specific laws, licensing requirements, labor laws, environmental regulations, taxation, and import/export restrictions. This often involves commissioning a detailed legal and compliance due diligence through both local and international counsel.

**2. Building Local Expertise:**  
Recognizing that regulatory environments can be nuanced, the CEO typically ensures the organization engages with local advisors, consultants, or hires experienced compliance officers in the market. Partnering with reputable local legal and accounting firms is a common strategy.

**3. Stakeholder and Government Engagement:**  
CEOs often build relationships with relevant regulatory bodies and government agencies early in the process. Attending industry events, working with business chambers, or enlisting the help of lobbyists can provide valuable insights and help resolve ambiguities.

**4. Internal Compliance Framework:**  
To institutionalize compliance, the CEO ensures that robust internal processes, training, and systems are in place. This includes adopting international best practices, such as regular compliance audits, an internal reporting mechanism for issues, policy manuals aligned with local laws, and ongoing employee training.

**5. Risk Assessment and Contingency Planning:**  
The CEO evaluates regulatory risks as part of the overall market-entry strategy. This involves identifying areas of uncertainty, potential changes in the law, or gray zones that require careful monitoring. The CEO will typically have contingency plans in place should unexpected regulatory challenges arise.

**6. Continual Monitoring and Adaptation:**  
Recognizing that regulations evolve, the CEO mandates ongoing monitoring of the regulatory environment and rapid adaptation of policies and operations as required. This is frequently supported through local compliance teams and periodic engagement with external advisors.

**In summary:**  
A strong CEO ensures a proactive, informed, and systematic approach to identifying and managing regulatory hurdles. By blending rigorous due diligence, strategic stakeholder engagement, local expertise, and robust internal controls, the CEO paves the way for a compliant and successful market entry.
