To maximize shareholder value, a CEO prioritizes capital allocation among competing projects by employing a disciplined, multi-step approach:

1. **Strategic Alignment**: The CEO ensures that potential projects align with the company’s long-term strategy and core competencies, prioritizing those that advance competitive advantage or strategic positioning.

2. **Rigorous Financial Analysis**: Each project is evaluated using financial metrics such as Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), and payback period. Projects with the highest risk-adjusted returns and positive NPV are favored.

3. **Risk Assessment**: The CEO considers both the risks and potential rewards of each project, assessing factors such as market volatility, execution complexity, regulatory changes, and resource requirements.

4. **Capital Constraints and Opportunity Cost**: Allocation decisions factor in the company’s capital constraints and the opportunity cost of choosing one project over another or alternative uses of capital (such as dividends, share buybacks, or debt repayment).

5. **Portfolio Diversification**: The CEO maintains a balanced portfolio of projects, mixing higher-risk, high-reward initiatives with more predictable investments to stabilize overall returns.

6. **External Stakeholder Considerations**: Shareholder interests are weighed alongside other stakeholders (customers, employees, regulators), particularly for projects with long-term implications.

7. **Dynamic Review and Flexibility**: Capital allocation is an ongoing process. The CEO regularly reviews project performance and market conditions, reallocating capital as necessary to ensure funds continue to drive maximum shareholder value.

**In summary:** The CEO prioritizes capital allocation by objectively comparing projects based on strategic fit, financial returns, risk, and available resources, while remaining flexible and responsive to changing circumstances to ensure the highest possible value for shareholders.
