The CEO demonstrates a high level of effectiveness in proactively identifying and preparing for potential risks that could impact the organization’s future stability. They have established structured processes for regular risk assessments, including horizon scanning, scenario planning, and the use of key risk indicators. The CEO fosters a risk-aware culture by encouraging open communication and cross-functional input, which helps surface emerging threats early.

Additionally, the CEO ensures that risk considerations are integrated into strategic decision-making and maintains a strong partnership with the board and relevant committees for oversight. They prioritize the development of robust contingency plans, allocate resources to risk mitigation, and periodically test crisis response protocols through simulations and reviews.
