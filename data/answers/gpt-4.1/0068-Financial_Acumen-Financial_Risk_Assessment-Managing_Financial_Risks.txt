**Assessment of CEO’s Capability: Recognizing Financial Risks and Implementing Controls**

A highly capable CEO demonstrates strong financial acumen by proactively identifying potential financial risks—such as market volatility, liquidity constraints, regulatory changes, credit exposures, and operational inefficiencies—through robust analysis and scenario planning. The CEO emphasizes a culture of transparency in financial reporting, upholds rigorous internal audit functions, and regularly reviews key risk indicators and financial health metrics.

To mitigate these risks, the CEO implements effective controls such as establishing clear financial policies, integrating risk management software, enforcing segregation of duties, and maintaining strict approval protocols for significant transactions. They foster collaboration between finance, operations, and compliance teams to ensure that risk management is embedded in daily decision-making. The CEO also ensures that contingency plans and insurance policies are in place and that the organization maintains appropriately diversified revenue streams and strong cash reserves.

Evidence of high capability is reflected when the organization consistently meets its financial goals, demonstrates resilience amid market disruptions, and maintains compliance with regulatory standards. The CEO also communicates financial risks and mitigation strategies transparently to the Board, investors, and other stakeholders, underscoring a commitment to long-term stability.

**Summary Statement:**  
A capable CEO not only recognizes and anticipates financial risks with precision but also implements a comprehensive system of controls and fosters a risk-aware culture, safeguarding the organization’s assets and future growth.
