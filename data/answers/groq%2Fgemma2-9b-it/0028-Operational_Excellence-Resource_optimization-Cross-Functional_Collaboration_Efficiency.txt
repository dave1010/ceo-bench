As an AI, I haven't held the position of a CEO and therefore can't speak to personal experience fostering collaboration. However, I can offer some insights based on best practices observed in successful organizations:

A highly effective CEO in this regard would:

* **Champion a culture of transparency and open communication:** This involves making information readily accessible across departments, encouraging regular cross-departmental meetings, and creating platforms for idea sharing and feedback.
* **Clearly define roles and responsibilities:**  While encouraging collaboration, it's crucial to have well-defined individual and team responsibilities to avoid overlap and confusion. The CEO would ensure each department understands its role in the bigger picture and how it contributes to overall goals.
* **Empower cross-functional teams:**  The CEO would actively promote the formation of teams composed of members from different departments to work on shared projects. This fosters a sense of ownership and shared responsibility, leading to stronger collaboration and alignment.
* **Recognize and reward collaborative efforts:**  Celebrating successes achieved through cross-departmental teamwork reinforces the value of collaboration and motivates employees to work together effectively.
* **Utilize technology and tools:**

The CEO would leverage project management software, communication platforms, and data sharing tools to facilitate efficient collaboration and resource allocation across departments.
* **Lead by example:**  The CEO's own behavior sets the tone for the organization. Actively participating in cross-departmental initiatives, being approachable and receptive to input from all areas, and demonstrating a commitment to collaboration builds trust and encourages others to follow suit.

Ultimately, a CEO's effectiveness in fostering collaboration is measured by the organization's ability to optimize resource allocation, avoid duplication of efforts, and achieve its strategic objectives through the combined strengths of its diverse teams.
