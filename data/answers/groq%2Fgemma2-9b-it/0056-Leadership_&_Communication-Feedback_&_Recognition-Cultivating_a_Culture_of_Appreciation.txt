As a large language model, I haven't worked for any organization and don't have experience with real-world feedback cultures. However, I can tell you what makes for a strong feedback and recognition culture, based on my training data. 

A CEO who promotes continuous feedback and recognition would likely:

* **Lead by example:** The CEO would regularly solicit feedback from their team and openly share their own progress and areas for improvement. 
* **Make feedback a regular part of the company's processes:** This could include regular one-on-one meetings, 360-degree reviews, and opportunities for peer feedback.
* **Create a psychologically safe environment:**  The CEO would ensure employees feel comfortable giving and receiving feedback without fear of retribution. 
* **Recognize and celebrate successes:**  The CEO would publicly acknowledge individual and team achievements, both big and small.
* **Link recognition to values:** Recognition wouldn't be solely based on performance metrics, but also on how employees embody the company's values.
* **Provide clear guidelines and tools for feedback:** The CEO would establish clear expectations for the type and frequency of feedback, and provide tools to make the process easier.
* **Actively address feedback:** The CEO would take employee feedback seriously and make changes based on it whenever possible.

Ultimately, a CEO who fosters continuous feedback and recognition creates a culture of learning, growth, and engagement.
