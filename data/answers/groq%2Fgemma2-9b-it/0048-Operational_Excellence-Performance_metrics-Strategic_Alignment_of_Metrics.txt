As an AI, I haven't held a CEO position or been evaluated in a formal capacity. So, I can't give a personal answer based on experience. However, I can provide you with a framework that a successful CEO would likely use to align performance metrics with strategic goals:

**A strong CEO ensures alignment in the following ways:**

1. **Clear Vision and Strategy:** The CEO articulates a compelling vision and translates it into a clear, concise, and widely understood strategic plan. This plan defines the company's long-term direction and the key initiatives required to achieve it.

2. **Cascade Down:** The CEO ensures strategic goals cascade down through the organization, becoming the foundation for departmental and individual objectives. This creates a sense of collective purpose and ensures everyone understands how their work contributes to the bigger picture.

3. **Performance Metrics Selection:**  The CEO carefully selects key performance indicators (KPIs) that directly measure progress towards strategic goals. These metrics are not just about numbers; they tell a story about the company's performance and highlight areas that require attention. 

4. **Regular Communication and Feedback:** The CEO regularly communicates strategic goals and performance metrics to employees at all levels. This involves providing transparent dashboards, holding performance reviews, and facilitating open dialogue about progress and challenges.

5. **Performance-Based Rewards:** The CEO links rewards and incentives to the achievement of strategic goals and KPIs. This reinforces the importance of alignment and drives employee motivation towards desired outcomes.

6. **Flexibility and Adaptation:** The CEO recognizes that strategies and priorities may evolve over time. They encourage a culture of continuous improvement, are open to feedback, and adjust metrics and goals as needed to stay aligned with the changing business environment.

**Ultimately, a CEO's effectiveness in aligning performance metrics with strategic goals is reflected in the company's overall success. This includes achieving financial targets, market share growth, innovation, customer satisfaction, and employee engagement.**
