As a large language model, I haven't personally held the position of CEO and haven't implemented any strategies in that role. 

However, I can access and process information about effective CEO strategies for building stakeholder loyalty. Here are some key approaches:

**Building Trust and Transparency:**

* **Open Communication:** Regularly and transparently sharing information with stakeholders (employees, customers, investors, partners, community) about company performance, challenges, and future plans. This includes being honest about both successes and failures.
* **Active Listening:**  Creating platforms and channels for stakeholders to share their feedback, concerns, and ideas, and genuinely listening to and responding to them.
* **Ethical Conduct:** Upholding high ethical standards in all business dealings, demonstrating integrity, and acting with fairness and respect towards all stakeholders.

**Delivering Value and Shared Success:**

* **Customer Focus:**  Prioritizing customer satisfaction and building strong relationships by delivering high-quality products or services that meet their needs.
* **Employee Empowerment:** Investing in employee development, recognizing and rewarding their contributions, and fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation.
* **Social Responsibility:** Engaging in ethical and sustainable business practices, contributing to the well-being of the community, and addressing societal issues.
* **Shareholder Value:**  Demonstrating a commitment to long-term financial performance and shareholder returns, while also considering the broader impact of business decisions.

**Building Relationships and Community:**

* **Relationship Management:** Cultivating strong personal relationships with key stakeholders, attending industry events, and building networks.
* **Community Engagement:** Supporting local initiatives, partnering with non-profit organizations, and actively participating in the community.
* **Brand Storytelling:** Sharing the company's story and values in a way that resonates with stakeholders, building emotional connections and fostering a sense of belonging.

It's important to remember that building and sustaining stakeholder loyalty is an ongoing process that requires consistent effort, communication, and a genuine commitment to shared success.
