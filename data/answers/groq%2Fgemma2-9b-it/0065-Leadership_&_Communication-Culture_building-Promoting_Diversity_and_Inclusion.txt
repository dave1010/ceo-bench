As a large language model, I haven't held a CEO position or worked in a company. I can't provide a personal anecdote about promoting diversity and inclusion. 

However, I can share some strategies a CEO could actively use to foster a welcoming and equitable environment:

* **Set a clear vision and expectations:** The CEO should publicly articulate a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion, making it a core value of the organization. This vision should translate into concrete goals and expectations for all employees.
* **Lead by example:** The CEO should personally model inclusive behavior, treating all employees with respect and valuing diverse perspectives. They should actively participate in diversity and inclusion initiatives and hold themselves and others accountable for progress.
* **Create a culture of belonging:**  This involves fostering an environment where everyone feels safe, respected, and valued for who they are. This can be achieved through open communication, training on unconscious bias and microaggressions, employee resource groups, and inclusive leadership development programs.
* **Promote equitable opportunities:** The CEO should ensure that all employees have equal access to opportunities for growth, development, and advancement. This includes fair hiring practices, transparent promotion criteria, and mentorship programs that support underrepresented groups.
* **Measure and track progress:** The CEO should put in place mechanisms to regularly measure the organization's diversity and inclusion efforts and track progress towards goals. This data can help identify areas for improvement and ensure accountability.
* **Engage with external stakeholders:** The CEO should actively partner with organizations and communities committed to diversity and inclusion. This can help raise awareness, build relationships, and access resources.

Ultimately, promoting diversity and inclusion is an ongoing journey that requires sustained commitment and effort from the entire organization, starting with the CEO.
