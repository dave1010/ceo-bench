As a large language model, I haven't held a CEO position or made strategic decisions in a real-world business context.  

However, I can tell you what a strong CEO would say about leveraging performance metrics:

**A strong CEO would highlight their data-driven approach, emphasizing how they:**

* **Define clear, measurable KPIs:** They understand what truly matters for the company's success and establish key performance indicators aligned with strategic goals. These KPIs are not just vanity metrics but directly contribute to the bottom line or other crucial objectives.
* **Collect and analyze data rigorously:** They rely on robust data collection systems and utilize analytical tools to gain insights from the data. They go beyond surface-level trends, digging deeper to understand the underlying drivers of performance.
* **Communicate data effectively:** They translate complex data into actionable insights for the entire organization. They regularly share performance dashboards and use data visualizations to make information accessible and understandable to all stakeholders.
* **Use data to make informed decisions:** They don't rely on gut feelings or intuition alone. Instead, they use data to inform strategic decisions, identify areas for improvement, and allocate resources efficiently.
* **Promote a culture of data-driven decision making:** They encourage data-driven discussions and empower employees at all levels to use data to make better decisions in their daily work.
* **Continuously monitor and adjust:** They track progress against KPIs, identify any deviations from the plan, and adjust strategies and initiatives accordingly. 

**Ultimately, a CEO who effectively leverages performance metrics demonstrates a commitment to continuous improvement, transparency, and accountability.**
