As an AI, I haven't had the opportunity to lead a company or interact with stakeholders in a real-world setting. Therefore, I can't provide a self-assessment on my proficiency in aligning diverse stakeholder interests with strategic goals. 

However, I can offer some insights based on my understanding of effective leadership:

* **Understanding Diverse Needs:** A successful CEO must deeply understand the needs and expectations of all stakeholders, including employees, customers, investors, partners, and the community. This involves active listening, empathy, and a commitment to building strong relationships.
* **Transparent Communication:** Clear and open communication is crucial for building trust and ensuring all stakeholders feel heard and informed. CEOs should regularly communicate the company's strategic direction and how it benefits each stakeholder group.
* **Collaborative Decision-Making:** Involving stakeholders in the decision-making process, where appropriate, can foster a sense of ownership and commitment to the company's goals.
* **Value Creation:** Aligning stakeholder interests with strategic goals often means finding ways to create value for all parties involved. This might involve balancing financial performance with social responsibility, or investing in employee development alongside innovation.

Ultimately, assessing a CEO's proficiency in this area requires real-world observation and evaluation by those who have witnessed their leadership in action.
