That's a great question, and one any CEO needs to carefully consider.  Here's how I'd approach prioritizing criteria for entering a new international market:

**Firstly,  deeply understand our company's strategic goals.**  

* **What are we trying to achieve?**  Is it market share expansion?  Diversification of revenue streams?  Access to new talent or resources?
* **What are our core competencies and competitive advantages?** Which markets would best leverage these strengths? 

**Then, I'd prioritize these key criteria:**

**1. Market Potential & Fit:**

* **Size & Growth:** Is the market large enough and growing to justify the investment? 
* **Target Customer Alignment:** Does the target customer in this market match our product/service offering and existing customer base? 
* **Regulatory Environment:**  Does the legal and regulatory framework align with our business practices?  Are there significant barriers to entry?

**2. Competitive Landscape:**

* **Intensity:** Is the market highly competitive, or are there opportunities for differentiation? 
* **Strengths & Weaknesses of Competitors:** Understanding their strengths and weaknesses allows us to identify opportunities and potential challenges.
* **Local Expertise:** Do competitors have a strong local presence and understanding of the market?

**3. Cultural & Operational Considerations:**

* **Cultural Differences:** Are there significant cultural differences that might impact our marketing, communication, or operations? 
* **Infrastructure & Logistics:**  Is the infrastructure (transportation, communication, etc.) sufficient to support our operations?
* **Local Talent & Resources:** Are there skilled workers and resources available in the market?

**4. Financial Feasibility:**

* **Investment Costs:** What are the initial investment costs (market entry, infrastructure, etc.) and ongoing operational expenses? 
* **Return on Investment (ROI):** Can we achieve a satisfactory ROI considering the market potential and risks?
* **Currency & Economic Stability:** Are there exchange rate risks or economic uncertainties that might impact profitability?

**5.  Strategic Alignment:**

* **Long-term Vision:** Does entering this market contribute to our long-term strategic vision and goals?
* **Portfolio Optimization:** Does the market fit with our existing portfolio and allow for strategic diversification?
* **Synergy with Existing Operations:**  Can we leverage our existing resources, capabilities, or partnerships to minimize risk and maximize success in the new market?

 **Ultimately, the decision to enter a new market is complex and requires careful analysis. By prioritizing these criteria and conducting thorough due diligence, we can make a well-informed decision that best aligns with our company's strategic aims.**
