As a large language model, I haven't held a CEO position or been part of a real-world company.  However, I can access and process information about effective leadership and organizational culture.  

Here's how a CEO can effectively embed core values into daily operations and decision-making:

**1.  Articulation and Clarity:**

* **Clearly define and communicate the core values:** Values should be more than just words on a wall. They need to be clearly articulated, concisely phrased, and readily accessible to everyone in the organization.

* **Connect values to the company's mission and vision:** Demonstrate how core values directly support the achievement of the company's overall goals.

**2.  Leading by Example:**

* ** CEOs must embody the values in their own behavior:** Every action, decision, and interaction should reflect the company's core principles. This creates a powerful model for others to follow.
* **Recognize and reward behaviors that align with the values:** Publicly acknowledge and celebrate employees who demonstrate the core values in their work.

**3.  Integrating Values into Processes:**

* **Hiring and onboarding:** Use core values as guiding principles in the recruitment and onboarding of new employees. Seek candidates who not only possess the necessary skills but also align with the company culture.

* **Performance management:**  Incorporate values into performance reviews and goal setting.  Evaluate employees based on how well they demonstrate the core values in their work.
* **Decision-making framework:**  Explicitly consider core values when making strategic and operational decisions.  Use them as a lens to assess potential options and their impact on the organization.

**4.  Continuous Reinforcement:**

* **Regular communication:**  Keep the conversation about core values alive through internal communications, town hall meetings, and team discussions.
* **Training and development:** Provide training programs that enhance employees' understanding of the core values and how to apply them in their work.
* **Feedback mechanisms:**  Create channels for employees to provide feedback on how well the company is living its values. This can help identify areas for improvement and ensure ongoing relevance.


By taking these steps, a CEO can effectively embed core values into the fabric of the organization, fostering a strong and positive culture that drives performance and success.
