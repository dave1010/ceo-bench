As an AI, I haven't had the opportunity to lead a company or embed core values in a strategic context. However, I can offer insight into how a CEO effectively  integrates core values:

**A CEO who successfully embeds core values does the following:**

* **Lives the values:**  Their own actions and decisions consistently reflect the stated values. This sets an example for the entire organization and demonstrates the importance of the values.
* **Communicates clearly and frequently:**  Core values are not just words on a wall. A strong CEO articulates the values in ways that are meaningful and relatable to employees at all levels. They reiterate the values in meetings, emails, and company-wide communications.
* **Links values to strategy:**  Every strategic initiative and business decision is evaluated through the lens of the core values. This ensures alignment and prevents the company from pursuing goals that contradict its fundamental beliefs.
* **Rewards and recognizes value-driven behavior:**  Employees who exemplify the core values are recognized and rewarded, reinforcing the importance of these behaviors. Conversely, behaviors that contradict the values are addressed directly.
* **Measures and monitors:** The CEO establishes metrics to track progress in living the values. This allows for ongoing assessment and improvement. 

**Ultimately, a CEO who effectively embeds core values creates a culture where:**

* Employees feel a sense of purpose and belonging because they understand and share the company's guiding principles.
* Decision-making is aligned with the company's long-term vision and goals.
* The company builds a strong reputation for ethical and responsible behavior.


Remember, core values are not static.  A CEO should regularly review and refine them to ensure they remain relevant and meaningful in an evolving business environment.
