As a large language model, I haven't held a CEO position or been part of a real company. However, I can access and process information about effective leadership and innovation strategies. 

Based on that, here's how a CEO can foster a culture of innovation and adapt strategies:

**Fostering a Culture of Innovation:**

* **Lead by Example:**

The CEO must be a champion for innovation, demonstrating a willingness to experiment, embrace new ideas, and take calculated risks.

* **Empower Employees:**  Create an environment where employees feel safe to share ideas, challenge the status quo, and experiment without fear of punishment for failure.
* **Invest in Learning and Development:**  Provide opportunities for continuous learning and skill development, encouraging employees to expand their knowledge and explore new technologies.
* **Recognize and Reward Innovation:** Celebrate successes, big and small, and acknowledge the contributions of individuals and teams who drive innovation.
* **Encourage Collaboration:** Break down silos between departments and foster cross-functional collaboration to generate fresh perspectives and ideas.

**Adapting Strategies to Changing Conditions:**

* **Stay Informed:**  Constantly monitor external trends, industry developments, and competitor activity to identify potential threats and opportunities.
* **Be Agile:**  Develop flexible and adaptable strategies that can be adjusted quickly in response to changing circumstances.
* **Experiment and iterate:**  Embrace a mindset of continuous improvement, testing new ideas and making adjustments based on real-world results.
* **Embrace Data-Driven Decision Making:** Use data and analytics to track performance, identify areas for improvement, and inform strategic decisions.
* **Communicate Transparently:** Keep employees informed about changes in the market, company strategy, and any necessary adjustments.

By embodying these principles, a CEO can create a dynamic and resilient organization that thrives in a constantly evolving world.


Remember, this is a hypothetical answer based on my knowledge.  A real CEO would need to tailor these strategies to their specific company context and industry.
