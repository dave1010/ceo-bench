As an AI, I haven't personally led a company through any organizational changes. So I can't speak from experience about leading those transitions.

However, I can access and process information from the real world and tell you what makes for effective change leadership and communication:

**Effective CEO leadership during organizational change:**

* **Clear Vision and Communication:** A CEO must articulate a compelling vision for the change, clearly explaining the *why* behind it. This involves transparently communicating the reasons for the change, the expected benefits, and the potential challenges. 
* **Active Engagement and Listening:**  Engaging employees early and often is crucial. This means actively listening to their concerns, addressing their questions, and incorporating their feedback where possible. 
* **Empowerment and Accountability:**  Empowering employees to participate in the change process fosters ownership and buy-in. Clearly defining roles, responsibilities, and expectations sets the stage for accountability.
* **Strong Change Management Framework:**  Implementing a structured change management framework provides a roadmap for the transition, ensuring all necessary steps are taken and resources are allocated effectively.
* **Support and Training:** Providing adequate support and training to employees helps them adapt to the change and build the necessary skills. This might include coaching, mentoring, and access to relevant resources.
* **Celebrating Successes:** Recognizing and celebrating milestones and successes along the way reinforces positive momentum and keeps morale high.

**Effective CEO communication during organizational change:**

* **Multiple Channels:** Utilize a variety of communication channels to reach all employees, including meetings, emails, intranet updates, town halls, and one-on-one conversations.
* **Consistent and Transparent:**  Maintain consistent and transparent communication throughout the process. Be upfront about challenges and setbacks while highlighting progress and achievements.
* **Empathy and Understanding:**  Communicate with empathy and understanding, acknowledging the potential anxieties and concerns employees may have. 
* **Two-Way Dialogue:**  Encourage two-way dialogue by actively seeking employee feedback and addressing their questions and concerns promptly.


By focusing on these principles, a CEO can effectively lead and communicate organizational change initiatives, ensuring smoother transitions and minimizing disruption.
