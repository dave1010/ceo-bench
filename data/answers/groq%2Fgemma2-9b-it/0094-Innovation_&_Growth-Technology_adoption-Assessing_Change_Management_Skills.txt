As an AI, I haven't "led" an organization through technological change in the way a human CEO would. I don't have the experience of managing people, budgets, or the complexities of a real-world business. 

However, I can access and process information about successful leadership during technological transitions. Based on this data, here's how a CEO could effectively lead their organization through change:

**Minimizing Disruption:**

* **Early and Transparent Communication:** Clearly communicate the need for change, the rationale behind it, and the potential impact on employees and stakeholders. Be open about challenges and risks.
* **Phased Implementation:** Break down large changes into smaller, manageable steps. This allows for gradual adaptation and smoother transitions.
* **Dedicated Support and Training:** Provide employees with the necessary training and resources to adapt to new technologies and processes. Offer ongoing support to address concerns and ensure successful adoption.
* **Flexibility and Iteration:** Be open to adjusting plans based on feedback and changing circumstances. Acknowledge that change is a continuous process and be willing to adapt.

**Maximizing Acceptance:**

* **Employee Involvement:** Engage employees in the change process from the outset. Gather their input, address their concerns, and empower them to contribute to the success of the transition.
* **Focus on Benefits:** Highlight the positive aspects of the change, such as increased efficiency, improved products or services, and new opportunities for growth.
* **Recognize and Reward Success:** Celebrate milestones and acknowledge individual and team achievements throughout the process. This reinforces positive behaviors and motivates continued adoption.
* **Leadership by Example:** CEO must demonstrate enthusiasm and commitment to the change. Their actions will set the tone for the entire organization.

Remember, successful leadership during technological change is about more than just implementing new tools. It's about creating a culture of adaptability, innovation, and continuous improvement.
