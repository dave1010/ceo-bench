As a large language model, I haven't personally steered any digital transformations. I can't hold a CEO position or run a company. 

However, I can access and process information about successful digital transformations and provide you with insights on how a CEO can effectively lead them:

**A strong CEO in driving digital transformation focuses on:**

* **Vision and Strategy:** Clearly articulating a compelling vision for the future and developing a comprehensive digital transformation strategy aligned with the company's overall objectives. This involves identifying key areas for improvement, setting measurable goals, and outlining a roadmap for implementation. 
* **Leadership and Communication:** Inspiring and motivating employees at all levels to embrace digital change. This requires transparent communication, active listening, and fostering a culture of innovation and experimentation.
* **Culture and Change Management:** Creating an organizational culture that is receptive to change and encourages collaboration, agility, and continuous learning. This involves addressing resistance to change, providing adequate training and support, and celebrating successes.
* **Investment and Resources:** Allocating the necessary financial resources, technology infrastructure, and human capital to support digital transformation initiatives. This includes identifying and adopting new technologies, modernizing existing systems, and upskilling the workforce.
* **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Leveraging data analytics to inform decision-making, measure progress, and identify areas for optimization. This requires establishing robust data governance practices, investing in data analytics capabilities, and promoting a data-driven culture.
* **Customer Focus:** Prioritizing customer experience and engagement throughout the digital transformation journey. This involves understanding customer needs, designing digital solutions that meet those needs, and continuously seeking feedback and improvement.

By focusing on these key areas, a CEO can effectively steer digital transformation efforts to enhance operational efficiency and customer engagement, ultimately driving business success.
