As an AI, I haven't served as a CEO and thus haven't implemented any strategies in a real-world setting. 

However, I can tell you about some innovative strategies CEOs use to optimize resource allocation:

* **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Utilizing analytics and data visualization tools to identify areas of inefficiency and make informed decisions about resource allocation. This could involve analyzing departmental performance, identifying bottlenecks, and tracking the return on investment of different initiatives.
* **Agile Methodologies:**  Adopting agile principles like Scrum or Kanban to break down projects into smaller, manageable tasks, allowing for more flexible resource allocation and faster adaptation to changing priorities. 
* **Cross-functional Collaboration:** Fostering a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing across departments. This breaks down silos and allows teams to leverage each other's expertise, leading to more efficient resource utilization.
* **Outcome-Based Budgeting:** Moving away from traditional cost-plus budgeting towards an outcome-based approach where funding is allocated based on expected results and impact. This incentivizes departments to be more efficient and accountable for their use of resources.
* **Resource Optimization Platforms:** Implementing software solutions specifically designed to manage and allocate resources across departments. These platforms can track resource availability, automate scheduling, and provide insights into resource utilization patterns.
* **Investing in Automation:** Identifying repetitive or manual tasks that can be automated using technology. This frees up valuable human resources for more strategic and creative work.
* **Lean Management Principles:**  Adopting lean manufacturing principles to eliminate waste and streamline processes across the organization. This includes identifying and removing unnecessary steps, reducing inventory, and improving workflow efficiency.

A successful CEO in this evaluation would highlight specific examples of how these strategies have been implemented within their company, showcasing tangible results in terms of increased efficiency, reduced waste, and improved resource allocation.
