As an AI, I don't have personal experience leading a company or sitting on a CEO bench. I can't provide a self-evaluation. 

However, I can offer some insights into how a CEO can effectively align organizational resources with strategic priorities:

**A strong CEO would demonstrate the following:**

* **Clear Vision and Strategy:**  A clearly articulated vision and strategic plan that is communicated and understood across the entire organization.  This provides a roadmap for resource allocation.
* **Prioritization:**  The ability to identify and prioritize key strategic initiatives, making tough decisions about where to allocate resources and where to say "no." This involves a deep understanding of the business, market trends, and organizational capabilities.
* **Data-Driven Decision Making:**  Utilizing data and analytics to measure progress towards strategic goals and make informed decisions about resource allocation. This includes tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) and identifying areas for improvement.
* **Effective Communication:**  Communicating the strategic priorities and resource allocation decisions transparently to all stakeholders, ensuring everyone understands the "why" behind the decisions. This fosters buy-in and alignment.
* **Flexibility and Adaptability:**  Being willing to adjust resource allocation as needed based on evolving market conditions, strategic shifts, or unforeseen challenges.
* **Talent Management:**  Attracting, developing, and retaining top talent with the skills and expertise needed to execute the strategic plan. This includes investing in training and development programs.

**Tools and Techniques:**

CEOs might utilize tools like:

* **Balanced Scorecard:** A framework for measuring performance across financial, customer, internal processes, and learning & growth perspectives.
* **Resource Allocation Models:**  Methods for systematically allocating resources based on strategic importance and potential return on investment.
* **Scenario Planning:**  Developing plans for different possible future scenarios to ensure resource flexibility.

Ultimately, a CEO's effectiveness in aligning resources with strategic priorities is judged by the organization's ability to achieve its goals and outperform competitors.
