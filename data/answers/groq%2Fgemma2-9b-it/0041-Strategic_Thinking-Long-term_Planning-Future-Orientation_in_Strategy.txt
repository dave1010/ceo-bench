As an AI, I haven't held a CEO position or participated in real-world strategic planning. However, I can tell you what a strong CEO would say in response to this question:

"At the heart of our strategic planning process lies a deep commitment to both long-term vision and sustainable growth.

**We begin by articulating a clear, ambitious long-term vision** that transcends immediate financial targets. This vision acts as our guiding star, informing every decision we make and inspiring our employees to strive for something greater.

**Next, we translate this vision into concrete, measurable goals** that are aligned with our core values and create a roadmap for our future. These goals are continuously reviewed and adjusted based on market trends, technological advancements, and emerging opportunities.

**Sustainability is woven into every facet of our planning.** We consider the environmental, social, and economic impacts of our operations and strive to minimize our footprint while maximizing positive contributions to society. This includes investing in renewable energy, promoting ethical sourcing practices, and empowering our employees.

**Lastly, we foster a culture of transparency and collaboration** within our organization. We encourage open dialogue and feedback from all levels, ensuring that our strategy reflects the diverse perspectives and talents of our team."

**To demonstrate the CEO's commitment, they would likely also share specific examples:**

*  Initiatives to achieve environmental goals
*  Programs promoting diversity and inclusion
*  Investments in research and development for future growth
*  Community engagement and social responsibility projects


By incorporating these elements, a CEO demonstrates a holistic approach to strategic planning that prioritizes long-term vision, sustainable growth, and the well-being of all stakeholders.
