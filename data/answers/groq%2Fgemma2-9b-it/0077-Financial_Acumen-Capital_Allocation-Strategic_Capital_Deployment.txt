As a large language model, I haven't made any real-world investment decisions. However, I can provide a framework for how a CEO can make informed capital allocation decisions to maximize ROI while supporting strategic priorities:

**1. Define Clear Strategic Priorities:**

* The CEO must articulate a clear and concise vision for the company's future. This vision should translate into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) strategic objectives. 

**2. Conduct Thorough Market and Financial Analysis:**

* **Market Analysis:**  Understand industry trends, competitive landscape, customer needs, and potential growth opportunities. 
* **Financial Analysis:** Evaluate the company's financial performance, strengths and weaknesses, cash flow, and risk profile. This includes internal analysis (e.g., cost structure, profitability, cash generation) and external analysis (e.g., macroeconomic factors, interest rates, market valuations).

**3. Identify Potential Investment Opportunities:**

* Generate a pipeline of potential investment projects aligned with the strategic priorities. These could include:
    * **Organic Growth:**  Investing in R&D, new product development, marketing initiatives, or operational improvements.
    * **Acquisitions & Mergers:**  Acquiring companies that complement existing business lines, expand into new markets, or provide access to new technologies.
    * **Strategic Partnerships:** Collaborating with other companies to leverage complementary strengths and share risks.

**4. Evaluate Investment Proposals Rigorously:**

*  Use a standardized framework to evaluate each investment opportunity, considering factors like:
    * **Potential ROI:** Projected financial returns, including net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and payback period.
    * **Strategic Alignment:** How well the investment supports the company's long-term strategic goals.
    * **Risk Assessment:** Identify and quantify potential risks associated with the investment and develop mitigation strategies.
    * **Resource Availability:** Ensure that the company has the necessary financial, human, and technological resources to execute the investment effectively.

**5. Make Informed Decisions and Communicate Transparently:**

*  Based on the evaluation, the CEO makes a decision on which investments to pursue. This decision should be clearly communicated to the board of directors, executives, and other stakeholders.  
*  The CEO should establish a system for ongoing monitoring and performance measurement of funded projects to ensure they are meeting expectations.


 **Important Traits:**

* **Data-driven Decision-Making:** Relying on sound financial analysis and market data.
* **Long-Term Vision:** Focusing on investments that create sustainable value over time.
* **Risk Management:** Carefully assessing and mitigating potential risks.
* **Agility and Adaptability:** Being willing to adjust the investment strategy as market conditions change.
* **Effective Communication:** Clearly articulating the investment rationale and performance to all stakeholders.
