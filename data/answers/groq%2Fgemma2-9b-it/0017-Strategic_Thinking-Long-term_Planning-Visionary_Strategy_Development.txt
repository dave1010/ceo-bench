As a large language model, I can't embody the role of a CEO or have personal experiences. However, I can share a framework a successful CEO might use to craft and communicate a long-term vision:

**Crafting the Vision**

1. **Deep Dive into Understanding:**  A strong vision starts with a thorough understanding of the company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis). This involves listening to employees, customers, and industry experts to gather insights.
2. **Defining Core Values:**  The vision should be rooted in the company's core values. These values guide decision-making and inspire employees to act in alignment with the overall purpose.
3. **Looking Beyond the Horizon:**  A long-term vision considers not just the immediate future, but also potential trends, technological advancements, and societal shifts that could impact the industry. 
4. **Setting Ambitious, Yet Attainable Goals:**  The vision should be inspiring and ambitious, pushing the company to strive for greatness. However, it needs to be grounded in realism and backed by a clear strategy for achieving it.

**Communicating the Vision**

1. **Clear and Concise Language:** The vision should be expressed in simple, memorable language that resonates with everyone in the organization. Avoid jargon and technical terms.
2. **Storytelling:**  Weaving a compelling narrative around the vision helps people connect with it emotionally and understand its significance. 
3. **Multiple Channels:** Communicate the vision through various platforms â€“ company meetings, intranet, newsletters, leadership presentations, and even informal conversations. 
4. **Living the Vision:**  The CEO and leadership team must embody the vision in their actions and decisions. This demonstrates commitment and inspires others to follow.
5. **Regular Check-ins and Feedback:**   The CEO should create opportunities for employees to share their thoughts on the vision, ask questions, and provide feedback. This ensures everyone is aligned and working towards the same goal.


Remember, a successful long-term vision is not static. It should evolve and adapt as the company grows and the world changes.  Continuous communication and engagement are key to keeping the vision alive and driving organizational growth.
