Getting started with schemas

LLMs are great at creating test data. Let’s define a simple schema for a dog, using LLM’s concise schema syntax. We’ll pass that to LLm with llm --schema and prompt it to “invent a cool dog”:

llm --schema 'name, age int, one_sentence_bio' 'invent a cool dog'
I got back Ziggy:

{
  "name": "Ziggy",
  "age": 4,
  "one_sentence_bio": "Ziggy is a hyper-intelligent, bioluminescent dog who loves to perform tricks in the dark and guides his owner home using his glowing fur."
}
The response matched my schema, with name and one_sentence_bio string columns and an integer for age.
