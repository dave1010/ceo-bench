Landing page site is Next.JS
Most of the actual dev is Python scripts. Only run npm commands if you're changing JS code.

Use the /dev directory for development notes and WIP stuff.

See /ROADMAP.md for the implementation roadmap. Prefix items with DONE as you work on them.

See /dev/CONTEXT.md for context and directory structure.

That's it! Good luck!
